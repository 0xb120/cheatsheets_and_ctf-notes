Applications running on Android 5.0-7.0 signed with v1, and v2/v3 scheme is also vulnerable.  MANIFEST ANALYSIS HIGH: 11 | WARNING: 22 | INFO: 00 | SUPPRESSED: 00 NONO ISSUEISSUE SEVERITYSEVERITY DESCRIPTIONDESCRIPTION 1 App can be installed on a vulnerable Android version [minSdk=21] warning This application can be installed on an older version of android that has multiple unfixed vulnerabilities. Support an Android version > 8, API 26 to receive reasonable security updates. 2 Clear text traffic is Enabled For App [android:usesCleartextTraffic=true] high The app intends to use cleartext network traffic, such as cleartext HTTP, FTP stacks, DownloadManager, and MediaPlayer. The default value for apps that target API level 27 or lower is \"true\". Apps that target API level 28 or higher default to \"false\". The key reason for avoiding cleartext traffic is the lack of confidentiality, authenticity, and protections against tampering; a network attacker can eavesdrop on transmitted data and also modify it without being detected. 3 Broadcast Receiver (com.techuz.privatevault.service.MyBroadcastReceiver) is not Protected. An intent-filter exists. warning A Broadcast Receiver is found to be shared with other apps on the device therefore leaving it accessible to any other application on the device. The presence of intent-filter indicates that the Broadcast Receiver is explicitly exported.  CODE ANALYSIS HIGH: 11 | WARNING: 77 | INFO: 11 | SECURE: 11 | SUPPRESSED: 00 NONO ISSUEISSUE SEVERITYSEVERITY STANDARDSSTANDARDS FILESFILES bolts/MeasurementEvent.java butterknife/ButterKnife.java com/bumptech/glide/Glide.java com/bumptech/glide/gifdecoder/GifH eaderParser.java com/bumptech/glide/gifdecoder/Stan dardGifDecoder.java com/bumptech/glide/load/data/Asset PathFetcher.java com/bumptech/glide/load/data/HttpU com/bumptech/glide/load/data/HttpU rlFetcher.java com/bumptech/glide/load/data/Local UriFetcher.java com/bumptech/glide/load/data/media store/ThumbFetcher.java com/bumptech/glide/load/data/media store/ThumbnailStreamOpener.java com/bumptech/glide/load/engine/Dec odeJob.java com/bumptech/glide/load/engine/Dec odePath.java com/bumptech/glide/load/engine/Eng ine.java com/bumptech/glide/load/engine/Gli deException.java com/bumptech/glide/load/engine/Sou rceGenerator.java com/bumptech/glide/load/engine/bit map_recycle/LruArrayPool.java com/bumptech/glide/load/engine/bit map_recycle/LruBitmapPool.java com/bumptech/glide/load/engine/cac he/DiskLruCacheWrapper.java com/bumptech/glide/load/engine/cac he/MemorySizeCalculator.java com/bumptech/glide/load/engine/exe cutor/GlideExecutor.java com/bumptech/glide/load/engine/pre fill/BitmapPreFillRunner.java com/bumptech/glide/load/model/Byt eBufferEncoder.java com/bumptech/glide/load/model/Byt eBufferFileLoader.java com/bumptech/glide/load/model/File Loader.java com/bumptech/glide/load/model/Res ourceLoader.java com/bumptech/glide/load/model/Stre amEncoder.java com/bumptech/glide/load/resource/bi NONO ISSUEISSUE SEVERITYSEVERITY STANDARDSSTANDARDS FILESFILES 1 The App logs information.
