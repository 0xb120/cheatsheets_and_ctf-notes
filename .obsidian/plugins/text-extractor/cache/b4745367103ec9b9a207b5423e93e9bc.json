{"path":"VR/disclosure-policy-v1.0.pdf","text":"Disclo sure Po licy Current version: v1.0, last changed on October 17, 2023, 14.40 This polic y governs the process ado pted by 0xbro for reporting and disclosing vulnerabilities to product or security vendors, customers, developers, and the general public. 0xbro will always at tempt to coordin ate all reported vulnerabilities with the af fected parties following a coordinated vulnerability disclosure process (also known as responsible disclosure process). Coordinated disclosure is the mos t effective approach to address vulnerabilities and ensure the protection of customers. Despite this, the af fected parties frequently exhibit deliberate negligence, excessive delays in developing nec essary fixes, or lack of transparenc y towards vulnerability reports submitted them, leaving customers exposed for an irresponsible amount of time. For this reason, 0xbro may disclose vulnerabilities to the general public fifteen (15) days after the last cont act attempt without response (s ee process bel ow). Depending on the circumstances , including active exploitation, significa nt or minor threats, or the need to modify an existing standard, the timing of disclosure may be adjusted either earlier or later . Disclosure process: 1. The first contact attempt will be through any formal mechanisms listed on the af fected party web site (eg. an explicit security contact, contacts inside /.well-known/security.txt , etc.), or by sending an e-mail to security@, support@, info@, and secure@company .com request ing information about a security referen t and a secure channel over which disclosing the technical vulnerability detail s. 0xbro will never prov ide information or insights about the vulnerability during this stage. 2. If the first attempt is not followed by a response within seven (7) days, a message requesting the security conta ct e-mail address may initially be sent to certain publi c contacts associated with the af fected party (eg. public forms , general e-mails, social media, etc.) in what is considered a second contact attempt . Also in this case, 0xbro will never pr ovide information or insights about the vulnerability during this stage.. 3. If the second attempt is not follo wed by a response within seven (7) days, the disclosure dates is set fifteen (15) days later . 4. If the involved pa rty response is received within the fourteen (7+7) days timeframe outlined above, 0xbro will send a report with the vulnerability details and some potential mitigation or workarounds. Fro m this moment, the involved party has thirty (30) days to address the vulnerability with a security patch or other corrective measure as appropriate. Extensions to the 30-day disclosure timeline may be granted depending on the complexity and the effort spent to fix the flaw . 5. If no response has been received after the 30-day disclosure timeline, the vulnerability is published immediately without further coordination attempts. 6. During the vulnerability analysis and remediation period , 0xbro expects regular updates about the ongoing activities and is willing to cooperate appropriately fo r solving the problem and conducting approp riate retests. If no updates are provided by default, the affected party will be contacted about once a week with a status update request. 7. If no response has been received after two (2) consecutive status update requests, no extension of the disclosure date shall be granted and the same rule as in 5th point applies. Vulnerabilities are disclosed to the public under these three circumstances: The pre-set/agreed disclosure date is reached. The involved party issues a fix and/or other corrective measure. Information about the same vulnerability is published by a third party . Under no circumstance s will a vulnerabili ty that has been discovered be suppressed or kept undisclosed due to the unwillingness of an involved party to address it. Delays ( not exceeding 15 days) to the disclosure date can be agreed upon following a fix to give customers time to install the appropriate patches. In respect of the researcher and the time invested, the af fected party is strongly encouraged to appropriately acknowledge and give credit to the reporter who submitted the issue.
