Issue detail The response contains the string: localStorage. Issue background HTMLS localStorage allows pages to persistently store data on a user's device, facilitating cross window exchange of information and managing bits of state on the client. You may see it as localStorage.setitem(), or .getitem(), or the shortcut version, localStorage.keyName. While local storage on the client is useful, this assumes the user endpoint can be trusted. In mission-critical applications, it may be more secure to manage all state on the server side. Issue remediation Discuss with developers if possible, to determine if there is a legitimate reason for storing data on a user's endpoint. The non-persistent sessionStorage object may be a safer alternative to localStorage, if state must be stored on the client.","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":"eng"}
