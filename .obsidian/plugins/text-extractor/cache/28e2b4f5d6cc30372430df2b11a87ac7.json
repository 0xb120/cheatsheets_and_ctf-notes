All u have done s advertised a non vulnerability at the top of my project issue list! U can't even do anything unless u already have permission to do it. What the fuck is wrong with u. Do u have some narcissism problem where u want to be the centre of attention where people are asking u what should we do to fix it. Are u building up a resume for a job? Oh | found this is issue and reported it on the cve but for got to tell everyone u need permission for it to work! Ur Fucking delusional! Ur not smart enough to be a programmer or a hacker.
