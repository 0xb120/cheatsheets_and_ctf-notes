> Automated pentest delivery replaces static reports, cutting weeks off remediation and reducing MTTR through real-time workflows.





as the threat landscape has evolved, the way we deliver pentest results hasn't kept pace.
Most organizations still rely on traditional reporting methods—static PDFs, emailed documents, and spreadsheet-based tracking.
The problem? These outdated workflows introduce delays, create inefficiencies, and undermine the value of the work.
Platforms like PlexTrac automate pentest finding delivery in real time through robust, rules-based workflows.
The Static Delivery Problem in a Dynamic World
Delivering a pentest report solely as a static document might have made sense a decade ago
Findings are buried in long documents that don't align with how teams operate day-to-day.
By the time remediation begins, days or weeks may have passed since the issues were discovered.
Why Automation Matters Now
As organizations adopt Continuous Threat Exposure Management (CTEM) and expand the frequency of offensive testing, the volume of findings rapidly grows. Without automation, teams struggle to keep up.
Benefits of automating pentest delivery include:

Real-time actionability: Act on findings immediately, not after the report is finalized
Faster response: Accelerate remediation, retesting and validation
Standardized operations: Ensure every finding follows a consistent process
Less manual work: Free teams to focus on strategic initiatives
Improved focus: Keep teams focused on what matters
Service providers gain a competitive advantage by automating delivery and integrating directly into client workflows, making themselves an indispensable partner to drive client value.
5 Key Components of Automated Pentest Delivery
Centralized data ingestion: Start by consolidating all findings—manual and automated—into a single source of truth.
Automated real-time delivery: As findings are identified, they should be automatically routed to the right people and workflows without waiting for the full report.
Automated routing & ticketing: Standardize routing by defining rules based on severity, asset ownership, and exploitability.
Standardized remediation workflows: Every finding from your centralized data should follow the same lifecycle from triage to closure based on the criteria you've set, regardless of source
Triggered retesting & validation: When a finding is marked as resolved, automation should trigger the appropriate retesting or validation workflow.
Avoid Common Pitfalls
Automation is about
building standardized, scalable systems.
Watch out for:
Overcomplicating early efforts:
Start small and focus on a few repeatable workflows first. Add complexity over time and expand as you validate success.
Treating automation as a one-time setup:
Your workflows should evolve alongside your tools, team structure, and priorities.
Automating without clearly defined workflows
How to get started
Map your current workflow
Identify friction points
Start small
Add complexity over time as you validate what's working well and use early results to evolve workflows, add rules, and further streamline.
Choose the right platform
Measure impact
Pentesting is too important to be stuck in static reports and manual workflows.
Conclusion
By automating delivery,
organizations can unlock the full value of their offensive security efforts
The future of pentest delivery is automated.
