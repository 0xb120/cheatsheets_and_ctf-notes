Fully autonomous AI hacker to find actual exploits in your web apps. Shannon has achieved a 96.15% success rate on the hint-free, source-aware XBOW Benchmark.
Features
Fully Autonomous Operation: Launch the pentest with a single command. The AI handles everything from advanced 2FA/TOTP logins (including sign in with Google) and browser navigation to the final report with zero intervention.
Pentester-Grade Reports with Reproducible Exploits: Delivers a final report focused on proven, exploitable findings, complete with copy-and-paste Proof-of-Concepts to eliminate false positives and provide actionable results.
Critical OWASP Vulnerability Coverage: Currently identifies and validates the following critical vulnerabilities: Injection, XSS, SSRF, and Broken Authentication/Authorization, with more types in development.
Code-Aware Dynamic Testing: Analyzes your source code to intelligently guide its attack strategy, then performs live, browser and command line based exploits on the running application to confirm real-world risk.
Powered by Integrated Security Tools: Enhances its discovery phase by leveraging leading reconnaissance and testing tools—including Nmap, Subfinder, WhatWeb, and Schemathesis—for deep analysis of the target environment.
Parallel Processing for Faster Results: Get your report faster. The system parallelizes the most time-intensive phases, running analysis and exploitation for all vulnerability types concurrently.
Real Results: Shannon discovered 20+ critical vulnerabilities in OWASP Juice Shop, including complete auth bypass and database exfiltration. See full report →
> [!danger]
> White-box only. Shannon Lite is designed for white-box (source-available) application security testing.
>It expects access to your application's source code and repository layout.
