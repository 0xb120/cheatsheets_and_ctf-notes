How I’m using Obsidian as a read-it-later app, while using Raindrop as a capture-all inbox, and how I discover new stuff.
Raindrop as an early inbox
Raindrop is the first element in my flow. With it, I’m capturing everything that catches my interest: links, videos, newsletters, and podcasts. The app acts like a capture-all inbox.
My Raindrop archive is organised in a few folders:

One for Temporary- for things I’m sure I would rather not transfer into Obsidian

One collection for Archive- for things that most likely will go into Obsidian

One final folder for everything that is archived or read into the app.
This system helps me keep my Obsidian vault fairly clean, as I can make a first review of what I have saved. And a nice quality of life thing: keeping all saved items in Raindrop, including those exported to Obsidian, eliminates the duplicates because the desktop browser add-on remembers what is saved.
Yes, I do read on Raindrop when I’m processing my archive, but also because the Android mobile app is working a bit better than Obsidian’s.
Raindrop has an unofficial plugin for Obsidian that will sync notes and highlights. It doesn’t do full content sync like Omnivore used to, but that’s better than nothing.
Obsidian as organiser and archive
Two elements are transforming Obsidian into a good read-it-later app: its web clipper and the core plugin Bases.
For my saved items, I run a simple database based on the ToRead and Read checkboxes. Of course, you can sort and filter based on the other metadata information like Author, Publish Date, Created Date or any other information you have there.
Feedle is a search engine for blogs and podcasts. In short, Feedle indexes RSS feeds and makes the content searchable.
Last on the list is Scour- a personalised content feed. From Bluesky posts, Medium, Substack, Reddit, RSS feeds and more, Scour can find a feed and include it in its recommendations. You start by adding some feeds and interests, and it will generate a list of recommendations.
