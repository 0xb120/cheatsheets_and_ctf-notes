The US is still lagging behind China in terms of vulnerability discovery and disclosure.
there are still hundreds of vulnerabilities registered in China that are yet to be listed on the US NVD. The CNNVD is a known subsidiary of the Chinese Ministry of State Security’s Technical Bureau, which drives Chinese cyber espionage, and has a history of altering CVE disclosure dates and providing APT groups with exploits.
I was threat hunting and I came across a vulnerability that was listed on the CNBC. So a database in China, but there was zero record of it in any US vulnerability databases. And so I was like, okay, well, what does it do? Who's it targeting? But also, is there any other vulnerability? Like how many other ones are out there that they are aware of that we are not aware of?
And it turns out there's a lot of vulnerabilities missing. And on top of that, they have a history of altering data and using high value cves for their own purposes.
the CNNVD, it's run by CNITSEC, which is an arm from the Ministry of State Security in China. And that would essentially be like if we had the CIA running our NVD program. And then you have the China National Vulnerability Database that's managed by like a China cert, which they say they're non-government non profit, kind of questionable, don't really believe that.
