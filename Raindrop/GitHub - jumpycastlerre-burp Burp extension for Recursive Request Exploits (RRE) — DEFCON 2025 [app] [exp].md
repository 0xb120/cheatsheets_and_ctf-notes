Burp extension for Recursive Request Exploits (RRE)
Recursive Request Exploits (RRE)
DEF CON 33 Slides: Paywall Optional: Stream for Free with a New Technique: RRE
⚡TLDR
Recursive Request Exploits (RRE) trace API chains backward from a protected resource (like a video stream) back to it's origin.
If any upstream API is unauthenticated, the whole chain can be abused to bypass access
This Burp extension automates this to find low-trust inputs that generate high-value outputs
What Is an RRE?

Recursive Request Exploits (RRE) are a methodology for recursively tracing interdependent web requests to discover how digital entitlements (e.g., video streams) are generated — and where validation breaks down.

What makes RRE unique, and hard to detect, is that it follows the business logic of the app. Instead of attacking one endpoint or API, you recursively walk the entire stream of requests that led to a sensitive output. If any request in that chain isn't properly authenticated, the entire workflow can be compromised and an entitlement can be spoofed.

A hypothetical RRE workflow is demonstrated below:
