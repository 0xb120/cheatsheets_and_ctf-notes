LLM Code Review vs Deterministic SAST Security Tools
How do the latest models stack up against traditional code scanners?
We’ve spent the last few months building Fraim to explore how we can use AI to tangibly increase a team’s security posture.

Conclusion

Static rules definitely have their place - but denouncing AI altogether because it’s non-deterministic is living in the past. The new flagship models are good, and they can produce deterministic results given the right inputs and prompts. We can then use the advantages of both AI and static rules to keep our environments safer than ever.
