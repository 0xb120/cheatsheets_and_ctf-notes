title: "Argusee: A Multi-Agent Collaborative Architecture for Automated Vulnerability Discovery"

description: |-
  As we envisioned in DARKNAVY INSIGHT | The Most Imaginative New Applications of 2024:
  The next generation of AI agents will have excellent reasoning and generalization abilities and be skilled at using a variety of security research tools, inheriting a wealth of human expert knowledge. They will be able to discover more 0-day vulnerabilities in the real world, like top security experts.
  Unsurprisingly, as Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate increasing proficiency in handling complex tasks, Agent technology is emerging as a new paradigm in the field of vulnerability discovery. Since Google Project Zero released Naptime[1] last year, an increasing number of Agent-based auditing tools are appearing. By providing LLMs with the necessary toolsets and source code for testing, these tools simulate the behaviour of security researchers to perform code audits and vulnerability confirmation.

> However, DARKNAVY has observed that single-agent approaches often suffer from false positives and negatives when auditing medium-to-large codebases, due to limitations in LLM reasoning

> [!info]
> Drawing on years of real-world vulnerability-hunting experience, DARKNAVY has proposed a multi-agent system architecture that simulates the division of labor and collaborative mechanisms within human security teams, and has implemented an automated vulnerability discovery tool called Argusee.

> [!info]
> Argusee: A Multi-Agent Collaborative Architecture

> [!info]
> Argusee is not intended to completely replace manual auditing or to discover vulnerabilities from scratch. Instead, it serves as a powerful assistant tool for security auditors. Given precise entry points (e.g., specific functions or modules) and relevant context from the auditor, Argusee performs in-depth analysis and identifies potential risks, thereby significantly enhancing the efficiency of professional auditors.

> [!info]
> Unlike existing work, Argusee’s core innovation lies in its multi-agent collaborative mechanism

> [!info]
> , enabling them to dynamically understand and delegate tasks, thus achieving more flexible and efficient collaborative auditing.

> [!info]
> As an implementation prototype, Argusee’s architecture, shown in the figure below, primarily includes the following core agents:

> [!info]
> Manager Agent
&gt;
&gt;The Manager is the interaction point for the user, who provides analysis entry points (e.g., target files or functions).

> [!info]
> Auditor Agent
&gt;
&gt;Auditors focus on analysing the typically smaller code snippets assigned by the Manager.

> [!info]
> Checker Agent
&gt;
&gt;To reduce false positives and negatives, before consolidating audit results and outputting the final conclusion, the Manager requests the Checker to review and verify the entire logical chain, identifying omissions and making corrections.

> [!info]
> During task execution, all Agents can call upon a predefined toolset as needed; the timing and method of tool use are autonomously decided by the Agent.

> [!info]
> To better understand Argusee’s workflow, the figure below illustrates Argusee’s chain of thought during an actual run:

> [!info]
> Looking ahead, to further unleash Argusee’s potential, based on the current prototype, Argusee can be enhanced and supplemented along the following three dimensions:
&gt;
&gt;Agent System: Introduce more specialised roles, such as a Reproducer Agent responsible for constructing PoCs to verify vulnerabilities, and an Exploit Agent to assess exploitability and attempt to write exploits.
&gt;Toolset: Integrate a richer set of analysis tools, such as debuggers, to help Agents understand program execution flow and vulnerability triggering processes, as well as other advanced static and dynamic analysis tools, building a powerful arsenal.
&gt;Target Projects and Environments: Integrate more information sources to assist code auditing, such as using RAG technology to retrieve relevant source code knowledge and analysing compiled binary files.

> [!info]
> Argusee is only the beginning of this trend.
