# Buttercup is now open-source!

> Now that DARPA's AI Cyber Challenge (AIxCC) has officially ended, we can finally make Buttercup, our CRS (Cyber Reasoning System), open source!





we can finally make Buttercup, our cyber reasoning system (CRS), open source.
To ensure as many people as possible can use Buttercup, we created a standalone version that runs on a typical laptop. We’ve also tuned this version to work within an AI budget appropriate for individual projects rather than a massive competition at scale.
How Buttercup works
Buttercup is a fully automated, AI-driven system for discovering and patching vulnerabilities in open-source software. Buttercup has four main components:
Orchestration/UI coordinates the overall actions of Buttercup’s other components and displays information about vulnerabilities discovered and patches generated by the system.
Vulnerability discovery uses AI-augmented mutational fuzzing to find program inputs that demonstrate vulnerabilities in the program.
Buttercup’s vulnerability discovery engine is based on OSS-Fuzz/Clusterfuzz and uses libFuzzer and Jazzer to find vulnerabilities.
Contextual analysis uses traditional static analysis tools to create queryable program models that are used to provide context to AI models used in vulnerability discovery and patching.
Patch generation is a multi-agentic system for creating and validating software patches for vulnerabilities discovered by Buttercup.
The following flowchart depicts how these components help Buttercup discover and patch vulnerabilities:

Getting started
We’ve made it easy for individual users to get Buttercup up and running on a typical laptop. Buttercup works best on x86-64 Linux systems, but does partially support ARM64 systems like macOS devices. You’ll need at least 8 CPU cores, 16 GB of RAM, 100 GB of free disk space, and an active network connection to run Buttercup.
You’ll also need to provide an API key for at least one third-party LLM provider like OpenAI or Anthropic.
All you need to do is clone Buttercup’s code repository, ensure that you have a few common system packages installed, and run a few easy commands in your terminal
Setup: Guides the user through installing Buttercup on the system and configuring it with AI API keys.
Deploy: Creates a fully localized cluster with all of Buttercup’s components running within pods.
Send task: Sends Buttercup a sample code repository with an intentionally inserted vulnerability to demonstrate Buttercup’s capabilities.
Open UI: Start up Buttercup’s browser-based UI to see the PoVs and patches that Buttercup has discovered.
