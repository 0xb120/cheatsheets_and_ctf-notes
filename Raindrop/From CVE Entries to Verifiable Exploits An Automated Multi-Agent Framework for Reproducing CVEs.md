# From CVE Entries to Verifiable Exploits: An Automated Multi-Agent Framework for Reproducing CVEs

![](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.01835v1/x1.png)





From CVE Entries to Verifiable Exploits:
An Automated Multi-Agent Framework for Reproducing CVEs
High-quality datasets of real-world vulnerabilities and their corresponding verifiable exploits are crucial resources in software security research. Yet such resources remain scarce, as their creation demands intensive manual effort and deep security expertise. In this paper, we present CVE-Genie, an automated, large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent framework designed to reproduce real-world vulnerabilities, provided in Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) format, to enable creation of high-quality vulnerability datasets. Given a CVE entry as input, CVE-Genie gathers the relevant resources of the CVE, automatically reconstructs the vulnerable environment, and (re)produces a verifiable exploit.
