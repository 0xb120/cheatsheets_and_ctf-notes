HexStrike AI MCP Agents is an advanced MCP server that lets AI agents (Claude, GPT, Copilot, etc.) autonomously run 150+ cybersecurity tools for automated pentesting, vulnerability discovery, bug bounty automation, and security research. Seamlessly bridge LLMs with real-world offensive security capabilities.
How It Works
AI Agent Connection - Claude, GPT, or other MCP-compatible agents connect via FastMCP protocol
Intelligent Analysis - Decision engine analyzes targets and selects optimal testing strategies
Autonomous Execution - AI agents execute comprehensive security assessments
Real-time Adaptation - System adapts based on results and discovered vulnerabilities
Advanced Reporting - Visual output with vulnerability cards and risk analysis
