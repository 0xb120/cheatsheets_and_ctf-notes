# Pentesting Next.js Server Actions [app]

Next.js server actions
appear in proxy tools as POST requests with hashed identifiers like a9fa42b4c7d1 in the Next-Action header, making it difficult to understand what each request actually does.
When applications have productionBrowserSourceMaps enabled, this Burp extension NextjsServerActionAnalyzer bridges that gap by automatically mapping these hashes to their actual function names.
The extension's effectiveness stems from understanding how Next.js bundles server actions in production. When productionBrowserSourceMaps is enabled, JavaScript chunks contain mappings between action hashes and their original function names.
The tool simply uses flexible regex patterns to extract these mappings from minified JavaScript.
The extension automatically scans proxy history for JavaScript chunks, identifies those containing createServerReference calls, and builds a comprehensive mapping of hash IDs to function names.
Automated Testing of Unused Actions

A useful feature of the extension is its ability to transform discovered but unused actions into testable requests.
Implementation

The extension works by:

Monitoring proxy history for requests containing Next-Action headers
Downloading JavaScript files referenced in the application
Parsing source maps when available to extract original function names
Creating a searchable mapping between hash IDs and function names
Highlighting potentially sensitive functions based on naming patterns
