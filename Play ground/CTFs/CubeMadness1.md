Running the game

# Exploitation

Inspect the memory multiple times until you find the possible memory locations for the value you are interested in:

![Untitled](../../zzz_res/attachments/CubeMadness1%205b6cfd5080cf49a8bdbd63916011018d%201.png)

Change the value to the desired one and obtain the flag:

Because the flag was not correct, search in memory the full one:
