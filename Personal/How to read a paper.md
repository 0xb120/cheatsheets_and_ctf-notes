# How to read a paper

Abstract: is a short, descriptive paragraph overviewing your entire paper from introduction to the findings or future studies

## The three-pass approach

Key idea: you should read the paper in up to three passes, instead of starting at the beginning and plowing your way to the end.
1. The first pass gives you a general idea about the paper. 
2. The second pass lets you grasp the paper’s content, but not its details. 
3. The third pass helps you understand the paper in depth.

### First pass (5-10 min)

1. Carefully read the title, abstract, and introduction 
2. Read the section and sub-section headings, but ignore everything else 
3. Read the conclusions
4. Glance over the references, mentally ticking off the ones you’ve already read

At the end of the first pass, you should be able to answer the five Cs: 
1. **Category**: What type of paper is this? A measurement paper? An analysis of an existing system? A description of a research prototype? 
2. **Context**: Which other papers is it related to? Which theoretical bases were used to analyze the problem? 
3. **Correctness**: Do the assumptions appear to be valid? 
4. **Contributions**: What are the paper’s main contributions? 
5. **Clarity**: Is the paper well written?

### Second pass (45 min - 1 h)

In the second pass, read the paper with greater care, but ignore details such as proofs. It helps to jot down the key points, or to make comments in the margins, as you read.

1. Look carefully at the figures, diagrams and other illustrations in the paper. Pay special attention to graphs.
2. Remember to mark relevant unread references for further reading (this is a good way to learn more about the background of the paper).

After this pass, you should be able to grasp the content of the paper. You should be able to summarize the main thrust of the paper, with supporting evidence, to someone else.

Sometimes you won’t understand a paper even at the end of the second pass. This may be because the subject matter is new to you, with unfamiliar terminology and acronyms. Or the authors may use a proof or experimental technique that you don’t understand, so that the bulk of the paper is incomprehensible. The paper may be poorly written with unsubstantiated assertions and numerous forward references. Or it could just be that it’s late at night and you’re tired. 

You can now choose to: 
(a) set the paper aside, hoping you don’t need to understand the material to be successful in your career
(b) return to the paper later, perhaps after reading background material
(c) persevere and go on to the third pass.

### Third pass (4 - 5 h)

The key to the third pass is to attempt to virtually re-implement the paper: that is, making the same assumptions as the authors, re-create the work. By comparing this re-creation with the actual paper, you can easily identify not only a paper’s innovations, but also its hidden failings and assumptions.

At the end of this pass, you should be able to reconstruct the entire structure of the paper from memory, as well as be able to identify its strong and weak points. In particular, you should be able to pinpoint implicit assumptions, missing citations to relevant work, and potential issues with experimental or analytical techniques.
