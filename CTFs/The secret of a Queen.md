[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babington_Plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babington_Plot)

The **Babington Plot** was a plan in 1586 to assassinate [Queen Elizabeth I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Elizabeth_I), a Protestant, and put [Mary, Queen of Scots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary,_Queen_of_Scots), her [Roman Catholic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church) cousin, on the English throne. It led to the Queen of Scots' execution, a result of a letter sent by Mary (who had been imprisoned for 19 years since 1568 in England at the behest of Elizabeth) in which she consented to the assassination of Elizabeth.
