A star is an astronomical object consisting of a luminous spheroid of plasma held together by its own gravity. The nearest star to Earth is the Sun. Many other stars are visible to the naked eye from Earth during the night, appearing as a multitude of fixed luminous points in the sky due to their immense distance from Earth. Historically, the most prominent stars were grouped into constellations and asterisms, the brightest of which gained proper names. Astronomers have assembled star catalogues that identify the known stars and provide standardized stellar designations.

Decompiled code:

# The Bug - Buffer Overflow

There is Buffer overflow in **star.c:** the program allocates 64 bytes to the `input` array, however it then read 512 bytes from stdin using `read(0,input,0x200);` overflowing adjacent memory locations. 

# Exploitation

Found the buffer overflow and calculated the offset:
