## Highlights


> Therefore, moder browers implemented a mechanism that allow them storing these files locally on the computer in order not to reload them everytime time. This mechanism is called the browser cache.

> If we take a look at how Firefox works, on Windows, we’ll see that there is indeed a directory located in the localappdata directory that stores what looks like files

> browsers will not cache any files proposed by a server. It will cache static ressources

> our goal is to force the download of either a DLL or an executable. To do so, we’ll simply have to change the content type related to the dll and exe files from:
>  application/x-msdos-program com exe bat dll
>  To:
>  image/jpg com exe bat dll

> when the DLL was downloaded and stored in the cache, it was renammed to a random filename without extension

> cached file is not just the DLL, it’s a specific file that contains both the file cached as well as metadata

> we need to do it to create a flag in the HTTP response of the server that will allow us identifying our DLL

> # Adding the header used to find the real DLL location /calc.dll { add_header Tag DLLHERE; }

> using powershell or batch we can grep for this specific string in order to find our DLL in the local cache directory
