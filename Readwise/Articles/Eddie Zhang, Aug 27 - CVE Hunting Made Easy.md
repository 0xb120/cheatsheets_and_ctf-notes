# CVE Hunting Made Easy

![rw-book-cover](https://projectblack.io/blog/content/images/2024/08/cve-hunting-feature-sr.png)

## Highlights


 Vulnerable software is plentiful, and with access to source code, we can automate the discovery of high-impact CVEs by focusing on breadth rather than depth.

 how many serious security issues can we find just by running some SAST scans on every WordPress plugin?

## How do we get a list of all plugins and download them reliably?
  As it turns out, this was a non-issue. WordPress publishes a public API that provides information about all plugins in their catalog, and it even includes a download link for each plugin. Awesome!
  If you want to take a look yourself, check out some of the raw output: [WordPress Plugin API](https://api.wordpress.org/plugins/info/1.2/?action=query_plugins&request%5Bpage%5D=1&request%5Bper_page%5D=10).

 SAST tools, in general, produce a lot of output. How do I triage and query this efficiently?
  I figured the best way to handle all this output was to store it in a SQL database. This way, the results could be easily queried and searched as needed.
  The next part of our script:
  - Runs Semgrep (unaffiliated) with the 'p/php' ruleset across each plugin.
  - Stores the raw Semgrep output in a JSON file in the plugin directory.
  - Parses this output and inserts it into a database.

 **couple of rules** for triaging the corpus so I wouldn't end up spending too much time

 - I only looked at the output for LFI (Local File Inclusion) and SQL injection rules.
  - The plugin must have a active install base greater than 0.
  - Vulnerabilities only exploitable by administrators will be ignored.
  - A maximum of 5 minutes will be spent **triaging** each Semgrep finding that looked *interesting.*

 just because a line of code looks like it could be vulnerable doesn’t mean it actually is. Our next step is to double-check that the issues flagged by Semgrep are genuinely exploitable.
  What we're effectively doing here is Sink - Source code review.

 Once we’ve identified a plugin that looks like it might be exploitable, the next step is to validate it through actual exploitation.

## Takeaways
  This was a fun project with a few takeaway learnings:
  - Unsurprisingly, most of plugins we disclosed issues for had a small install base, around 200-2,000 users, with the largest being *quiz-master-next*, which had over 40,000 installs at the time of writing.
  - There's more than one way to go CVE hunting. Usually, the focus is on depth—picking one product or codebase and reverse-engineering it thoroughly. Here, we took the opposite approach, going for breadth rather than depth.

 - If you're a pentester working on a WordPress site in your next test, take a closer look at the plugins installed on your customer's site. Just because there aren't any disclosed issues doesn't mean there aren't any easily discoverable vulnerabilities waiting to be found.
