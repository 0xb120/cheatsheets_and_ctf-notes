## XSS breaking context and DOMPurify by hamayanhamayan

This was the easiest among all the challenges, yet it teaches a nice quirk to achieve [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](../../Dev,%20ICT%20&%20Cybersec/Web%20&%20Network%20Hacking/Cross-Site%20Scripting%20(XSS).md) when server-side sanitization is applied.

There is some server-side logic where a query parameter is sanitized via my everlasting enemy #DOMPurify. Once sanitized, the payload is reflected into the page in two different points.
```html
 <div class="card">
 <h1>Paper Airplane</h1>
 <p class="message"><%- sanitized %></b></p>
 <form method="get" action="">
 <textarea name="message"><%- sanitized %></textarea>
 <p>
 <input type="submit" value="View ðŸ‘€" formaction="/" />
 </p>
 </form>
 </div>
```

How we can achieve XSS is quite simple. Essentially the sanitization that occurs server side has no context on what will be the context where our payload will be reflected.

By leveraging this assumption we can carefully create an HTML tag that when injected into the browser breaks the context but will be completely ignored by DOMPurify. How? By using [HTML attributes](../../Dev,%20ICT%20&%20Cybersec/Dev,%20scripting%20&%20OS/HTML.md#HTML%20attributes%20vs%20DOM%20properties) and [Different content parsing types](../../Dev,%20ICT%20&%20Cybersec/Dev,%20scripting%20&%20OS/HTML.md#Different%20content%20parsing%20types):
```html
<a id='</textarea><img src=a onerror=alert(origin)>'/>
```

The content of the `id` attribute will be completely ignored by DOMPurify, but when injected into the page it will break the `textarea` tag:

```html
<div class="card">
	<h1>Paper Airplane</h1>
    <p class="message"><a id="</textarea><img src=a onerror=alert(origin)>"></a></p>
    <form method="get" action="">
        <textarea name="message">&lt;a id="</textarea><img src="a" onerror="alert(origin)">"&gt;
        <p>
            <input type="submit" value="View ðŸ‘€" formaction="/">
        </p>
    </form>
</div>
```

## XSS with Charset Shenanigans by kinugawamasato - w/ strellic

```js
function render(html) {
      const sanitizedHtml = DOMPurify.sanitize(html, { ALLOWED_ATTR: [], ALLOW_ARIA_ATTR: false, ALLOW_DATA_ATTR: false });
      const blob = new Blob([sanitizedHtml], { "type": "text/html" });
      const blobURL = URL.createObjectURL(blob);
      input.value = sanitizedHtml;
      window.open(blobURL, "iframe");
      createPermalink(sanitizedHtml);
    }
```
Quite small, isnâ€™t it? Itâ€™s difficult to think that there is an XSS in here, but indeed there is.

The main idea is explained in [Encoding Differentials: Why Charset Matters](sonarsource.com%20-%20Encoding%20Differentials%20Why%20Charset%20Matters.md). In short, it explains how the charset affects how the browser parses the HTML on the page. Moreover it highlights a specific encoding `ISO-2022-JP` which can be leveraged to achieve [XSS](../../Dev,%20ICT%20&%20Cybersec/Web%20&%20Network%20Hacking/Cross-Site%20Scripting%20(XSS).md) on pages where the `Content-Type` header has no charset specified.

Apparently if a page opens a window and specify the window name viaÂ `window.open('/','whatever')`Â if the opened page opens a page with the same name, the page will be opened as theÂ ==top window==.

The flow, now, is the following:
- The bot visits a page
- The page executesÂ `window.open('https://challenge-kinugawa.quiz.flatt.training/?html=payload','iframe')`
- The Blob on the challenge page will open the sanitized payload as the top window instead that on the iframe. This will lead to a page with semi-arbitrary content without anyÂ ==charset==Â specified. Hence we can leverage the usage ofÂ #ISO-2022-JP in order to achieve XSS

If you have read the research, you may know that the sequence `\x1b(B` is used to switch the parsing to ASCII. Hence, something like `<style>\x1b(B<\x1b(Bimg</style>` should work. And indeed it works. This payload will be left untouched from DOMPurify since itâ€™s considered safe. Spoiler: itâ€™s not.

Now we have all we need. I should point out that there is CSP but is easily bypassable (iâ€™ve used cspbypass.com in order to find the payload)
