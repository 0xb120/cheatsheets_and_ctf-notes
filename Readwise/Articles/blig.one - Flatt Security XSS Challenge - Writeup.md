## Highlights


Server-Side Sanitization by hamayanhamayan [Permalink](https://blig.one/2024/11/29/flatt-xss-writeup.html/#server-side-sanitization-by-hamayanhamayan)
 This was the easiest among all the challenges, yet it teaches a nice quirk to achieve XSS when server-side sanitization is applied.

There is some server-side logic where a query parameter is sanitized via my everlasting enemy DOMPurify. Once sanitized, the payload is reflected into the page in two different points.
 <div class="card">
 <h1>Paper Airplane</h1>
 <p class="message"><%- sanitized %></b></p>
 <form method="get" action="">
 <textarea name="message"><%- sanitized %></textarea>
 <p>
 <input type="submit" value="View ðŸ‘€" formaction="/" />
 </p>
 </form>
 </div>

How we can achieve XSS is quite simple. Essentially the sanitization that occurs server side has no context on what will be the context where our payload will be reflected.
 By leveraging this assumption we can carefully create an HTML tag that when injected into the browser breaks the context but will be completely ignored by DOMPurify. How? By using attributes
 <a id='</textarea><img src=a onerror=alert(origin)>'/>

The content of the `id` attribute will be completely ignored by DOMPurify, but when injected into the page it will break the `textarea` tag

Charset Shenanigans by kinugawamasato - w/ strellic [Permalink](https://blig.one/2024/11/29/flatt-xss-writeup.html/#charset-shenanigans-by-kinugawamasato---w-strellic)

The main idea is explained here https://www.sonarsource.com/blog/encoding-differentials-why-charset-matters/. In short, it explains how the charset affects how the browser parses the HTML on the page. Moreover it highlights a specific encoding `ISO-2022-JP` which can be leveraged to achieve XSS on pages where the `Content-Type` header has no charset specified.

If you have read the research, you may know that the sequence `\x1b(B` is used to switch the parsing to ASCII. Hence, something like `<style>\x1b(B<\x1b(Bimg</style>` should work. And indeed it works. This payload will be left untouched from DOMPurify since itâ€™s considered safe. Spoiler: itâ€™s not

Now we have all we need. I should point out that there is CSP but is easily bypassable (iâ€™ve used cspbypass.com in order to find the payload)
