# CVE-2023-33466 - Exploiting Healthcare Servers With Polyglot Files

## But what is DICOM

DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) [^1], quoting from Wikipedia, is a *“standard protocol for the management and transmission of medical images and related data and is used in many healthcare facilities”*. [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jtnkdjmzgsekpabzs15kme8s)

To find out how to inject interesting payloads into valid DICOM files, we examined the [standard](https://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/chtml/part10/chapter_7.html) for a while. It seems that every DICOM “instance” is made up of a header, the *File Meta Information*, followed by the actual data. The first field of the header, the *File Preamble*, immediately catched our attention:

> A fixed 128 byte field available for Application Profile or implementation specified use. If not used by an Application Profile or a specific implementation all bytes shall be set to 00H. File-set Readers or Updaters shall not rely on the content of this Preamble to determine that this File is or is not a DICOM File.
