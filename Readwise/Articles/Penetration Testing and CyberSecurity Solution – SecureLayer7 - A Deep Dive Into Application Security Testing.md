> What is Application Security Testing? 
>  Application security refers to a process of evaluating applications for identifying and fixing potential vulnerabilities and various other security weaknesses. It encompasses web, mobile, and desktop applications, as well as APIs. Its primary purpose is to take proactive steps before  malicious actors can exploit these loopholes.

> Application security testing utilizes various techniques, including static and dynamic testing, penetration testing, and source code analysis.

> some key advantages it offers: reasons:
>  • AST helps protect business-critical data. Applications handle sensitive data, such as personal information, financial records, or intellectual property. Security testing ensures that threat actors can’t access this data. 
>  • It aids in compliance. Some industries are sensitive and have strict policies on data privacy and security matters, such as HIPAA, GDPR, OWASP, and NIST. Application security testing helps  avoid fines and legal implications that may arise out of noncompliance of mandatory compliances and standards. 
>  • It increases people’s trust in the organization. Regular application security tests can help prevent security breach incidents, thereby maintaining the organization’s integrity and reputation.
>  • It saves costs. The cost of fixing vulnerabilities in terms of money and time at the development stage is much less than dealing with security issues post deployment. 
>  • Application security test assists in managing new threats. The landscape of threats constantly changes, and new vulnerabilities are discovered regularly. Continuously conducting security tests helps ensure applications are protected against these threats. 
>  • It protects from third-party integrations. Many apps have third-party components or APIs integrated into them, which may expose your applications to security risks if they don’t have adequate security protocols.

> Application Security Testing Methodologies 
>  There are three types of application security testing methodologies, which include: 
>  • **Black-box security testing:** In black-box pen-testing, testers think out of the box and perform as real hackers. They attempt to break into a system like a malicious actor.  
>  • **White-box security testing:** In this case, testers know everything about the system. They have unrestricted access to the system, and they understand code base quality, API documentation, and internal designs. 
>  • **Gray-box security testing:** Here, testers have limited knowledge of the system and carry out focused attacks.

> Security Testing Best Practices
>  To maximize the effectiveness and thoroughness of application security testing process, security testers should adhere to these key practices:
>  • Develop a comprehensive understanding of the application’s structure, functions, and potential security risks. This helps write more targeted test cases to address entire security aspects of the application.
>  • Utilize a mix of white-box, black-box, and grey-box testing methodologies, as their combined use ensures a more robust and comprehensive security assessment.
>  • Given the rapid evolution of security threats and vulnerabilities, staying informed about industry developments is crucial. 
>  • Maintain close cooperation between QA engineers and developers. This helps mitigate security risks throughout the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and significantly reduces the potential for security breaches in the final product.
