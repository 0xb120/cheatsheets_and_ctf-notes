# Wapiti-Scanner/Wapiti: Web Vulnerability Scanner Written in Python3

![rw-book-cover](https://opengraph.githubassets.com/6dd5ba0f6316b388ad55f0fd9d83000b0cf40395b5cdfd1b9946627933f3e465/wapiti-scanner/wapiti)

## Highlights


Wapiti works as a "black-box" vulnerability scanner, that means it won't study the source code of web applications but will work like a fuzzer, scanning the pages of the deployed web application, extracting links and forms and attacking the scripts, sending payloads and looking for error messages, special strings or abnormal behaviors.
