# Analysis of CVE-2023-37474 in CopyParty

Python does a really unintuitive thing with `os.path.join`. [^1]

As soon as I put a slash here, everything before it gets truncated. It just goes back to the root. So if you have any of your things in `os.path.join` start with a slash, everything before it gets thrown away.
