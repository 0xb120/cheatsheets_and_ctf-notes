# Security Research Without Ever Leaving GitHub: From Code Scanning to CVE via Codespaces and Private Vulnerability Reporting

![rw-book-cover](https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Security-DarkMode-4.png)

## Highlights


Have you ever wondered how the [GitHub Security Lab](https://securitylab.github.com/) performs security research? In this post, you’ll learn how we leverage GitHub products and features such as code scanning, CodeQL, Codespaces, and private vulnerability reporting

Finding an interesting target
 The concept of an “interesting” target might have different meanings for each one of you based on the objective of your research.

Using GitHub Code Search
 Many times, we need to search widely for the use of a specific method or library. Either to get inspiration to use it, or pwn it , GitHub [code search](https://github.com/features/code-search) is there for us.

OpenSSF Criticality Score
 The OpenSSF created the [Open Source Project Criticality Score](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2020/12/finding-critical-open-source-projects.html), which “defines the influence and importance of a project. It is a number between 0 (least-critical) and 1 (most-critical).”

Forking the project
 Once we have identified our target, let’s fork the repository either via [GitHub’s UI](https://github.com/blakeblackshear/frigate/fork) or [CLI](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_repo_fork).

Code scanning and CodeQL
 [Code scanning](https://docs.github.com/code-security/code-scanning/introduction-to-code-scanning/about-code-scanning) is GitHub’s solution to find, triage, and prioritize fixes for existing problems in your code.

When code scanning is “connected” with a static analysis tool like GitHub’s CodeQL, that’s when the magic happens

**Learning CodeQL** 
 If you are interested in learning more about the world of static analysis, with exercises and more, go ahead and follow [@sylwia-budzynska](https://github.com/sylwia-budzynska)’s *[CodeQL zero to hero](https://github.blog/2023-03-31-codeql-zero-to-hero-part-1-the-fundamentals-of-static-analysis-for-vulnerability-research/)* series. You may also want to join GitHub Security Lab’s [Slack instance](http://gh.io/securitylabslack) to hang out with CodeQL engineers and the community.

**Running CodeQL at scale** 
 In this case, we are using CodeQL on a per-repository basis. If you are interested in running CodeQL at scale to hunt zero day vulnerabilities and their variants across repositories, feel free to learn more about [Multi-repository Variant Analysis](https://codeql.github.com/docs/codeql-for-visual-studio-code/running-codeql-queries-at-scale-with-mrva/).

Advanced configuration using Security Lab’s Community QL Packs
 With CodeQL’s default configuration (default workflow), you will already find impactful issues. Our CodeQL team makes sure that these [default queries](https://github.com/github/codeql) are designed to have a very low false positive rate so that developers can confidently add them to their CI/CD pipeline.

we recently published our [CodeQL Community Packs](https://github.com/GitHubSecurityLab/CodeQL-Community-Packs), and using it is as easy as a one-liner in your workflow file.

Browsing alerts
 A few minutes in, the results are shown in the Security tab; let’s dig in!

 Anatomy of a code scanning alert
 While you may think that running CodeQL locally would be easier, code scanning provides additional built-in mechanisms to avoid duplicated alerts, prioritize, or dismiss them. Also, the amount of information given by a single alert page can save you a lot of time!

GitHub Codespaces

 Codespaces banner
 [Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) is GitHub’s solution for cloud, instant and customizable development environments based on [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). In this post, we will be using Codespaces as our exploitation environment due to its safe (isolated) and ephemeral nature

Reporting vulnerabilities in open source projects has never been an easy subject for many reasons: finding a private way of communicating with maintainers, getting their reply, and agreeing on so-many topics that a vulnerability covers is quite challenging on a text-based channel. That is what [private vulnerability reporting](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability) (PVR) solves: a single, private, interactive place in which security researchers and maintainers work together to make their software more secure, and their dependent consumers more aware.
