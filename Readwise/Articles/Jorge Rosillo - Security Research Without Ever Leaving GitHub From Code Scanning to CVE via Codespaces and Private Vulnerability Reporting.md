# Security Research Without Ever Leaving GitHub: From Code Scanning to CVE via Codespaces and Private Vulnerability Reporting

![rw-book-cover](https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Security-DarkMode-4.png)

Have you ever wondered how the [GitHub Security Lab](https://securitylab.github.com/) performs security research? In this post, you’ll learn how we leverage GitHub products and features such as code scanning, [CodeQL](../../Dev,%20ICT%20&%20Cybersec/Tools/CodeQL.md), Codespaces, and private vulnerability reporting. [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jeecnwbd0npkzrdh6mt3qscp)

## Finding an interesting target

The concept of an “interesting” target might have different meanings for each one of you based on the objective of your research. [^1] [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jeecrdffbht8z4f4asyra8jh)
You can follow two approaches:
 1. Using GitHub Code Search

Many times, we need to search widely for the use of a specific method or library. Either to get inspiration to use it, or pwn it , GitHub [code search](https://github.com/features/code-search) is there for us. [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jeecsakm095vc0vq1x7hda4m)

2. OpenSSF Criticality Score

The [OpenSSF](OpenSSF%20-%20Understanding%20and%20Applying%20the%20OpenSSF%20Criticality%20Score%20in%20Open%20Source%20Projects.md) created the [Open Source Project Criticality Score](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2020/12/finding-critical-open-source-projects.html), which “defines the influence and importance of a project. It is a number between 0 (least-critical) and 1 (most-critical).” [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jeecvfk8sby91m5skqrwedh2)

## Forking the project

Once we have identified our target, let’s fork the repository either via [GitHub’s UI](https://github.com/blakeblackshear/frigate/fork) or [CLI](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_repo_fork). [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jeed1469rrv945z513nwqqer)

## Code scanning and CodeQL

[Code scanning](https://docs.github.com/code-security/code-scanning/introduction-to-code-scanning/about-code-scanning) is GitHub’s solution to find, triage, and prioritize fixes for existing problems in your code. [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jeed1fb3t4tfxc1w31856ryh)
![](https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/frigate-code-scanning.png?w=1600)
When code scanning is “connected” with a static analysis tool like GitHub’s [CodeQL](../../Dev,%20ICT%20&%20Cybersec/Tools/CodeQL.md), that’s when the magic happens [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jeed5f4b1v063c5109gbjmdz)

### Learning CodeQL

If you are interested in learning more about the world of static analysis, with exercises and more, go ahead and follow [@sylwia-budzynska](https://github.com/sylwia-budzynska)’s *[CodeQL zero to hero](https://github.blog/2023-03-31-codeql-zero-to-hero-part-1-the-fundamentals-of-static-analysis-for-vulnerability-research/)* series. You may also want to join GitHub Security Lab’s [Slack instance](http://gh.io/securitylabslack) to hang out with CodeQL engineers and the community. [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jeed3cvhp2dax6vdk480fqcq)
> #tools

### Running CodeQL at scale

In this case, we are using CodeQL on a per-repository basis. If you are interested in running CodeQL at scale to hunt zero day vulnerabilities and their variants across repositories, feel free to learn more about [Multi-repository Variant Analysis](https://codeql.github.com/docs/codeql-for-visual-studio-code/running-codeql-queries-at-scale-with-mrva/). [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jeed6g12v36payv38wjc6set)

### Advanced configuration using Security Lab’s Community QL Packs

With CodeQL’s default configuration (default workflow), you will already find impactful issues. Our CodeQL team makes sure that these [default queries](https://github.com/github/codeql) are designed to have a very low false positive rate so that developers can confidently add them to their CI/CD pipeline. [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jeeda80nd3z6xtp19w62gfcc)

We recently published our [CodeQL Community Packs](https://github.com/GitHubSecurityLab/CodeQL-Community-Packs) [^3], and using it is as easy as a one-liner in your workflow file. [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jeedb0x9nvn02zq264kebe9y)

## Browsing alerts

A few minutes in, the results are shown in the Security tab; let’s dig in!

### Anatomy of a code scanning alert

While you may think that running CodeQL locally would be easier, code scanning provides additional built-in mechanisms to avoid duplicated alerts, prioritize, or dismiss them. Also, the amount of information given by a single alert page can save you a lot of time!

## GitHub Codespaces

![](https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Codespaces-header.png?w=996&resize=996%2C526)
### Codespaces banner

[Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) is GitHub’s solution for cloud, instant and customizable development environments based on [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). In this post, we will be using Codespaces as our exploitation environment due to its safe (isolated) and ephemeral nature [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jeedfq9mxkvxda0yemkxqrrs). 

Reporting vulnerabilities in open source projects has never been an easy subject for many reasons: finding a private way of communicating with maintainers, getting their reply, and agreeing on so-many topics that a vulnerability covers is quite challenging on a text-based channel. That is what [private vulnerability reporting](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability) (PVR) solves: a single, private, interactive place in which security researchers and maintainers work together to make their software more secure, and their dependent consumers more aware.
