## Highlights


> To address this, we wanted to create a cheat sheet that consolidates all known payloads, saving you the time and effort of searching and gathering information from across the Internet. Today, we're excited to introduce a new tool designed to solve this problem: [the URL Validation Bypass Cheat Sheet](https://portswigger.net/web-security/ssrf/url-validation-bypass-cheat-sheet).

> The URL Validation Bypass Cheat Sheet is a brand new interactive web application that automatically adjusts its settings based on your context. Currently, there are three contexts available:
>  • A fully qualified absolute URL - useful for a situation where URL is used in a request query parameter for example. All payloads are designed to be Burp Suite Intruder friendly, so you don't have to worry about the correct encoding.
>  • Only hostname - direct input of the domain, such as in the Host header value.
>  • [CORS](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cors) Origin - where the hostname is intended to be used in a valid browser origin header.
