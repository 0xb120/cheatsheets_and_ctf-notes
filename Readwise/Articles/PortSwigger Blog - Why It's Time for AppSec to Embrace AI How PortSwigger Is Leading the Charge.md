# Why It's Time for AppSec to Embrace AI: How PortSwigger Is Leading the Charge

At PortSwigger, we believe AI has the power to transform penetration testing—not by replacing human testers, but by augmenting them. [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jmczhjjjs27fbs03gjr0kr1f)

That’s why [we’ve recently released Burp AI, the first AI-enhanced functionality for Burp Suite](https://portswigger.net/blog/the-future-of-security-testing-harness-ai-powered-extensibility-in-burp-nbsp), not as a gimmick or a response to hype, but to pave the way for creating the power tools that will make pentesters even better at what they do.

We've also added a new option to [download a starter project for building extensions](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/extensions/creating/development-environment/starter-project-setup) from within [Burpsuite](../../Dev,%20ICT%20&%20Cybersec/Tools/Burpsuite.md). This contains the boilerplate code to help you get coding quicker.

Every Burp Suite Professional user on the Early Adopter channel now has a bundle of **10,000 free AI credits**, so now is the perfect time to start experimenting. [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jmczxwtw33kefbw73hjqezka)
