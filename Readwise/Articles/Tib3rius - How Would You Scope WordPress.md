summary: WordPress powers over 40% of websites and often undergoes pentesting to find vulnerabilities. The author discusses the confusion around scoping pentests for WordPress, emphasizing that thorough testing may require more than the typical five days due to its complexity. He suggests that the industry should reconsider standard testing durations to reflect modern security needs.

# How Would You Scope WordPress?

I believe the average was 10 to 15 days, and then there were some people who said up to four weeks or even longer. [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jp62gs5jwgckhn0dvdtsze2s)

We're not interested in what a customer would be willing to pay. We are looking for an accurate scope of the work needed. [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jp62h4jpryc8nhz6ycxae58b)
When scoping a web app, we need to consider multiple factors, but the **two most important are generally the number of functions the application contains and the number of distinct user roles**. [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jp62knyeyrkg2rsm3aj7ntn8)


A customer might assume a five-day test is enough to fully assess their application, not realizing how many components actually require in-depth analysis. If a testing company simply agrees to a five-day engagement without clarifying the limitations, the customer may end up with a false sense of security about the results.

So what can we do about this? The key is education and communication. 

A proper scoping process should involve detailed discussions about the application, its complexity, and the customer's expectations. It's also important to explain the limitations of time-constrained testing. If a customer insists on a short engagement, they should at least be made aware that not all vulnerabilities may be uncovered within that timeframe.

What should the baseline for a standard web app pentest be? If the five-day standard is outdated, what should replace it? Perhaps itâ€™s time for the industry to reassess and redefine the minimum viable scope for modern web applications. Maybe ten days should be the new minimum, or maybe engagements should be explicitly broken down into phases where customers can opt for an initial assessment, followed by a more thorough deep dive.
