## Highlights


Weird Apache Behavior
 If you have been following [Orange's latest research on Apache](https://blog.orange.tw/posts/2024-08-confusion-attacks-en), you may be suspicious of the above RewriteRule:
 <Location "/">
 # ...
 RewriteRule ^(.*)(\/PAN_help\/)(.*)\.(css|js|html|htm)$ $1$2$3.$4.gz [QSA,L]
 # ...
 </Location>
 However, because this RewriteRule is in a location block, this rewrite happens in so-called ["per-dir" context](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/trunk/rewrite/tech.html#InternalAPI), which foils most of the attacks mentioned in the blog post. However, Apache still has some interesting implementation details in how it processes this RewriteRule. To explain this better, let's consider this simplified configuration:
 <Location "/">
 RewriteEngine On
 RewriteRule (.*)\.abc$ $1 [L]
 </Location>
 This rule strips the .abc extension from the end of a request, so /foo/hello.html and /foo/hello.html.abc end up requesting the same file. If we send a request to /foo/hello.html.abc, what happens in order is as follows:
 - mod_rewrite gets the requested file as foo/hello.html.abc and tests it against the rewrite rule.
 - Since the rule matches, mod_rewrite does the substitution and ends up with foo/hello.html
 - mod_rewrite then appends a slash as the front to get /foo/hello.html and does an "internal redirect" - this involves re-processing the request from the start as if the user had requested /foo/hello.html directly.
 ‚Äç
 The fact that Apache issues an internal redirect to implement per-directory rewrite rules has a couple of interesting consequences, which are not well documented. For example, environment variables set during the original request processing are dropped. Crucially for us, because the request is being processed twice, another effect is that the URL will be *url decoded twice*. Any information security professional will know about URL encoding - if we request either of:
 /foo/hello.html
 /foo/hello%25html
 We will see the contents of /foo/hello.html, since the request is URL decoded before processing. However, if we double encode and request /foo/hello%252ehtml, we will get a 404. This is because Apache only url decodes once, and a file hello%25html doesn't exist. However, if we request /foo/hello%252ehtml.abc, we do in fact see the content of hello.html ! The URL is being decoded twice; once on the initial request, and once on the internal redirect. If the rule is applied multiple times, this can get even crazier; a request like /foo/hello%25252ehtml.abc.abc will work to triple decode the URL, etc.

The Bug
 Let's return to PAN-OS and consider the following URL:
 /unauth/%252e%252e/php/ztp_gate.php/PAN_help/x.css
