## Patch-Diffing Tools

As usual, we eagerly fetched patched (22.7R2.6) and vulnerable (22.7R2.5) versions of the appliance, extracted their contents, and set about them with our favorite tools—[Beyond Compare](https://www.scootersoftware.com/?ref=labs.watchtowr.com), IDA Pro, and [Diaphora](https://github.com/joxeankoret/diaphora?ref=labs.watchtowr.com).
