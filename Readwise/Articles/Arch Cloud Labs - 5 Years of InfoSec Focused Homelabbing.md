# 5 Years of InfoSec Focused Homelabbing

## Highlights


## Applied Learning: Going from Idea to Blog Post
>  I, and likely you have a backlog of books, articles, Humble Bundle deals, and U-Demy courses that have piled up over the years. When you do identify time to dive into the backlog of `$THINGS_TO_READ` consider how you could immediately play with some of these concepts you’re learning in almost a “REPL” like fashion.

> By identifying a way to **immediately apply** what you’re learning or experimenting with, you can get those neurons firing and help make technical concepts stick and test assumptions you may have about a given topic/tool/API/etc…

> Not everything you blog about and build in your homelab needs to be production grade or realistic for enterprise environments. Part of the fun I have with homelab experiments, is developing systems which give you weird edge cases or ridiculous scenarios. These projects usually end up as great conversation pieces during interviews or in the worst case scenario a fun story to share over beers. The key takeaway here is to do projects you think are fun. When learning is fun, you’ll learn more. When your homelab feels like a job, stop.

## From CTFs to CVEs
>  A common response in the InfoSec industry to those looking to develop skills in Reverse Engineering/Malware Analysis/ Software Exploitation is to “do CTFs”.

> Unfortunately, I’ve found that this advice can be incorrectly interpreted as “do CTFs 24/7”. This is a sure fire way to burn yourself out, and become disinterested in the field.

> 1. Review old CTFs
>  If the CTF is an annual event, you may be able to browse and attempt previous challenges (*if there’s an archive*), and review associated writeups when you get stuck.

> Poke at CVEs
> [View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j76t1pd8dy77w292w3rzbm9m)



> Everyday new vulnerabilities are identified and reported by companies and researchers alike in the form of CVEs. While each CVE blurb varies in quality and content, for Open Source projects, you have the ability to go and grab the patch, and perform root cause analysis on the underlying vulnerability. If you, dear reader create a blog post detailing root cause analysis of a given vulnerability along with strategies for remediation then congratulations! You have just performed a common task of a AppSec engineer/security consultant/$OTHER_JOB_ROLE_HERE. This is **real world** experience

> For the super ambitious, try to create a PoC to exploit the vulnerability or build a utility to scan for said vulnerabilities.

> Doubling down on the CTF-to-CVE front, I’d also recommend looking for end-of-life (EOL) devices. Old routers and IoT devices are relatively inexpensive on eBay and once again make for fun adventures in rediscovering vulnerabilities from documented CVEs.

## Conclusion
>  Writing blog posts is a practical exercise in documenting and sharing with others lessons learned in a given subject. Effective technical communication is a critical component of almost any job role, and just another reason to register that domain today and start your homelab blog. When learning is fun, you’ll learn more. When your homelab feels like a job, stop.
