What Is Amazon S3?

TL;DR: it is a dedicated file storage solution in the cloud. It has the benefit that it is both very cheap and very easy to use.
 Amazon S3 is a good solution in its own right - it allows anyone with an Amazon account to host files and make them accessible to the entire Internet, without worries like ‘what if a hard drive fails’ or ‘do I have enough bandwidth’, or, “should I actually be sharing this with the world?”.
 In order to keep things neat and tidy, S3 gives users this magical space and place called a ‘bucket’ - effectively, a file-sharing space that can contain folders and folders.
 For example, we might decide to use Amazon S3 to host memes and register an S3 bucket called ‘watchTowrs-finest-memes’. This would result in the S3 URL (ignoring regions - not our job to teach this!) of `watchtowrs-finest-memes.s3.amazonaws.com` (this doesn't exist, hijack it you nerds).
 We could then upload files to this bucket, and reference said files within this S3 bucket anywhere we felt the need to via a regular HTTPS URL (like `https://watchTowrs-finest-memes.s3.amazonaws.com/our-fav-meme.exe`).
