# Refresh: Compromising F5 BIG-IP With Request Smuggling | CVE-2023-46747

![rw-book-cover](https://www.praetorian.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Vulnerability-Research-at-Praetorian-Labs.png)

## Highlights


authentication bypass issue that led to complete compromise of an F5 system with the Traffic Management User Interface (TMUI) exposed. The bypass was assigned [CVE-2023-46747](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-46747), and is closely related to [CVE-2022-26377](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-26377). [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hea8d2ekk1x13sb80ennv3g2)



the F5 vulnerability was also a request smuggling issue. [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hea8d8yg99gzvj196tw55z60)



proof of concept on Github [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hea8br3e5vapsjccj3nfbmgs)



We deployed a default F5 installation using a cheap [AWS Marketplace template](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-lphsy6izllsmq?sr=0-1&ref_=beagle&applicationId=AWSMPContessa) and began identifying components on the server. [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hea8j0s3mkb9a2ey05q0pz3t)



We knew from the previously discussed F5 vulnerabilities from 2020 and 2022 that a discrepancy in the way that frontend and backend systems interpreted a request was likely to result in an authentication bypass issue. [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hea8m91e8ba5298myg5c9jvg)



One of CVE-2022-26377’s original reporters wrote an [excellent blog post](https://ricterz-me.translate.goog/posts/2022-03-03-a-new-attack-method-ajp-request-smuggling.txt?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=wapp) describing the straightforward exploitation of the vulnerability. [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hea8n9bays8kfz51rdr0epqb)



A look at `/usr/share/tomcat/conf/server.xml` confirmed the usage of an AJP connector on Tomcat, [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hea8pmq8rkt0bzd11s1av8p5)



At a glance it appeared that hitting any `/tmui/` URL would be sufficient to trigger AJP smuggling. [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hea932e5k8vrbwby8dgs46ka)



we took the example AJP payload implementation from [RicterZ’s blog post](https://ricterz-me.translate.goog/posts/2022-03-03-a-new-attack-method-ajp-request-smuggling.txt?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=wapp)  and pointed it at a URL we knew would be publicly exposed–the login page. [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hea93cddchdc1f5q0bavf0m7)



$ curl -k -i http://our.f5.ami.ip:8443/tmui/login.jsp -H 'Transfer-Encoding: chunked, chunked' --data-binary @raw.dat [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hea951vxzwqw809c8thpm97v)



Interestingly enough, after a few curl requests, we occasionally would receive 404 Not Found responses instead of the expected login page. [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hea95ya8wmphss70wc01v6md)



By default the F5-BIGIP does not run a ROOT webapp, so the system returned a 404 instead. By explicitly creating a file at /usr/share/tomcat/webapps/ROOT/WEB-INF/web.xml, we were able to trigger the GhostCat LFI. [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hea97yq6ng1qeym3gtm40z2f)



So what exactly can we do with the ability to send arbitrary AJP packets? The Tomcat AJP connector is one mechanism for directing web request content to backend Java servlets. These servlets contain the conventional backend processing logic. [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hea9qarcfte3jkef6rb87qvd)



If we could smuggle completely arbitrary data as AJP packets this would give us the ability to invoke arbitrary servlets with entirely arbitrary content. [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hea9qxky2va64axxj4jfvyfa)



First, POST requests needed to be exactly 0x204 bytes (518). [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hea9r3jd3w4dbr1xz1xvxjhg)



Next, we could not actually send any POST body content with the smuggled request. [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hea9rcx2eme6jzt0qhydhftg)



Finally, we could only route to endpoints in the “/tmui” API. [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hea9rnf138h4x3tx38ksg1ze)



While we identified some interesting attack surface, such as potential paths to some classic Java deserialization attacks, the lack of ability to send a POST body prevented us from reaching those code paths [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hea9s671yttt56mr4hw5vg9e)



Eventually, we realized it might be easier to simply create a user for ourselves. [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hea9sfjt56635pnwxak1jrk6)



We verified that the request created a new administrator user on the backend, and sent another one to make sure it was the only request required (it was). However, we noticed a few important attributes that would preclude us from replicating and smuggling that same request to the backend. First, the content itself is sent as a POST body and the smuggled AJP request will not send POST body content properly. Second, the request included a Cookie that was set after we logged in to the application, so somehow we would need to determine if there is another way to authenticate to the relevant part of the code without that Cookie. Finally, the POST body Content-Length is 1726 bytes, which is much greater than our strict 518 byte requirement [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hea9vn9d40wbzwzqmsbsp2fw)



sending the POST body content as request query parameters worked and addressed the first of the three issues. [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01heaa5gayb96gbty0va54pvhg)



So to create the user successfully we simply added a “REMOTEROLE” header with value “0” to the smuggled AJP request [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01heaa9asgjd1x8q5axnn875ys)



We started stripping out a few parameters like “exit_button_before” and “enableObjList” at a time. After removing them, we resent the request and checked that it still created a new user. And then we repeated the process again and again. [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01heaaah1nbndkrh2esas2y64g)



After sending the smuggled request to create valid administrator credentials, we could authenticate to the F5 system using the standard authentication flow and run arbitrary commands through the “mgmt” API. [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01heaabfzpr1qyde6h2y80a341)
