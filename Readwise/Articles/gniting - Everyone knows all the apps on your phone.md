# Everyone knows all the apps on your phone

## Highlights


Until a few years ago, any app you installed on an Android device could see all other apps on your phone without your permission. [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jqnh6vzwgab323vzpmayvv4q)



with Android 11, Google removed this access from app developers. Under their new package visibility policy, apps *should* only see other installed apps if it’s essential to their core functionality. Developers must also explicitly declare these apps in the AndroidManifest.xml file - a required configuration file for all Android apps.
 For extremely specific use cases such as file managers, browsers or antivirus apps, Google grants an exception by allowing `QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES` permission, which provides full visibility into installed apps. [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jqnh7k7fhfm7jxbsa3vwh91b)
