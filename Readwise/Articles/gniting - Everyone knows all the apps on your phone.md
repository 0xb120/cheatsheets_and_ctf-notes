summary: Many apps on Android can see other installed apps on your phone, which raises privacy concerns. Despite new rules limiting this access, some popular Indian apps still collect extensive data about other apps without clear user consent. Users should be aware that installing apps may lead to their personal information being shared widely.

## Highlights


Until a few years ago, any app you installed on an Android device could see all other apps on your phone without your permission. [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jqnh6vzwgab323vzpmayvv4q)



with Android 11, Google removed this access from app developers. Under their new package visibility policy, apps *should* only see other installed apps if itâ€™s essential to their core functionality. Developers must also explicitly declare these apps in the AndroidManifest.xml file - a required configuration file for all Android apps.
 For extremely specific use cases such as file managers, browsers or antivirus apps, Google grants an exception by allowing `QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES` permission, which provides full visibility into installed apps. [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jqnh7k7fhfm7jxbsa3vwh91b)
