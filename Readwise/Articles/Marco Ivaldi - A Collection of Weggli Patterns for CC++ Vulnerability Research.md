# Weggli

[Weggli](https://github.com/weggli-rs/weggli) is a small yet powerful tool developed by [Felix Wilhelm](https://twitter.com/_fel1x) of [Google Project Zero](https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/).

# Vulnerability research methodology

my [vulnerability research workflow](https://security.humanativaspa.it/big-update-to-my-semgrep-c-cpp-ruleset/), which can be summarized as follows: ^a9c40c
1. Read the **documentation** to uncover attack surface and interesting paths.
2. Scan with **static analysis** tools against interesting paths in the codebase.
3. Review scan results to quickly **mark hotspots** in code where bugs may be.
4. Understand relevant code around the hotspots to identify **potential vulnerabilities**.
5. Confirm vulnerabilities via **further analysis**, dynamic testing, targeted fuzzing, etc.
6. Identify **variants** of confirmed vulnerabilities in other parts of the codebase.
