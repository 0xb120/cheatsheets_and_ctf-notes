# (CVE-2024-7008) Calibre Reflected Cross-Site Scripting

![rw-book-cover](https://starlabs.sg/logo-white.png)

## Highlights


Vulnerability Summary
 It is possible to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the `/browse` endpoint of the Calibre content server, allowing an attacker to craft a URL that when clicked by a victim, will execute the attacker’s JavaScript code in the context of the victim’s browser. If the Calibre server is running with authentication enabled and the victim is logged in at the time, this can be used to cause the victim to perform actions on the Calibre server on behalf of the attacker.
