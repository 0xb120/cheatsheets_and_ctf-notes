# Welcome to the Next Generation of Burp Suite: Elevate Your Testing With Burp AI

We’re introducing Burp AI - a suite of powerful new features designed to enhance your testing workflow, reduce noise, and give you deeper insight into vulnerabilities.
Burp AI is now built into Burp Suite Professional and includes five brand new features…
- **Explore Issue**: Use AI to automate follow-up analysis of vulnerabilities identified by [Burp Scanner](https://portswigger.net/burp/vulnerability-scanner), just like a pentester would.
- **Explainer**: get instant, security-focused insights into unfamiliar web technologies
- **AI-generated recorded login sequences**: reduce the tedious setup time of manually recording a login sequence.
- **False Positive Reduction - [Access Control](https://portswigger.net/web-security/access-control)**: smarter Scanning and fewer false positives, starting with access control vulnerabilities.
- **AI-powered extensions with the Montoya API**: enhance your existing extensions with AI, or build a brand-new extension optimised with AI. [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jqp5kxa2mqg9jmpcv74ajb8x)
