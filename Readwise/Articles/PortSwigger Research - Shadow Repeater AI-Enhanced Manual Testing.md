# Shadow Repeater: AI-Enhanced Manual Testing


Shadow Repeater, a plugin which enhances your manual testing *with AI-powered, fully automatic variation testing*. Simply use Burp Repeater as you normally would, and behind the scenes Shadow Repeater will monitor your attacks, try permutations, and report any discoveries via Organizer.

## How does Shadow Repeater work

Shadow Repeater monitors your Repeater requests and identifies which parameters you're changing. It then extracts the payloads you've placed in these parameters, and sends them to an AI model which generates variants. Finally, it attacks the target with these payload variations and uses response diffing to identify whether any of them triggered a new interesting code path.

By default, Shadow repeater gets invoked on the 5th repeater request you make, and it requires a parameter or header to be changed. [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jn1epxxwy130y49mv54m04j4)

When it's found something interesting it will send it to the organiser for inspection. [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jn1eq8xxmjbgxqabn0s3hqrd)
