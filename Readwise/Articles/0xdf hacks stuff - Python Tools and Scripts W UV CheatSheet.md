summary: UV is a new Python tool that simplifies packaging, project management, and running scripts. It is faster and more efficient than existing tools like pip and pipx. This post provides commands and tricks for using UV to install and manage Python applications easily.

# Python Tools and Scripts W/ UV CheatSheet

![rw-book-cover](https://0xdf.gitlab.io/img/uv-cs-cover.png)

## Highlights


UV is the hot new tool among Python developers. [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jtjqptndwj60brahtmxydxgd)



It addresses a ton of issues in the Python ecosystem, from packaging, project management, tool installation, and virtual environment management. [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jtjqq409ryrd6m4txwgh8ykd)



This post is all about how to use UV to install and run Python applications and scripts. [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jtjqqgv36a0jde7hpfc2qz1j)



I released a [video showing a lot of this in action](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G36QXtBXKBQ), and it’ll remain the more detailed explanation of this tool [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jtjqqs6pfdbzj7xna70438f0)



This post is going to show how I now use it to replace `pipx` for installing tools as well as `venv` for running Python scripts. [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jtjqrvd9s2x0201cztzwx9hq)



Installing `uv` is recommended to install using a shell script downloaded from their servers. [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jtjqscbkcm67rj5ztndr1z7g)



Overview
 Anywhere I used to use `pipx` I’m now using `uv tool`. Other than that replacement, the syntax is the same. [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jtjqsqp0stp1h17sa3zphk17)



oxdf@hacky$ uv tool install impacket Resolved 21 packages in 537ms Prepared 1 package in 522ms Installed 21 packages in 20ms + blinker==1.9.0 + cffi==1.17.1 [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jtjqsyqzwpcfjp6xxy52v062)



Install from GitHub:
 $ uv tool install git+https://github.com/Pennyw0rth/NetExec [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jtjqt8rtg2j81zrt6msw1ds2)



Install a specific branch from a GitHub repo:
 $ uv tool install git+https://github.com/dirkjanm/BloodHound.py.git@bloodhound-c [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jtjqtn9b5n4c84pxj9487njz)



Install from a local directory (where it is set up as a package with the legacy `setup.py` or `setup.cfg`, or the modern `pyproject.toml` file):
 $ uv tool install . [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jtjqv0dw00j2yhxm67t4fykh)



Updating
 `uv tool list` will show what packages are installed *and* what binaries are now runnable through those packages:
 oxdf@hacky$ uv tool list
 black v25.1.0
 - black
 - blackd
 bloodhound-ce v1.8.0
 - bloodhound-ce-python [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jtjqvcaz2psad7pvxh6x08x0)



`uv tool upgrade --all` or `uv tool upgrade <package>` will update to later version of these packages. [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jtjqvhqvz4qxeakv4cxq928z)



ScriptsRunningOverview
 A more interesting challenge is running Python scripts that aren’t set up with a package, but may just have a `requirements.txt` file listing their dependencies outside the Python standard library. [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jtjqweqavmwnpwnb018f3dcj)



With uv, I’ll add the dependencies to the script with in-line metadata, and then run it. [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jtjqwv674xgfcrqtsa99y54g)



The first step is to add the requirements to the script using [PEP 723 - inline script metadata](https://peps.python.org/pep-0723/).
 `uv add --script <target python script> <package name>` will add a single dependency:
 oxdf@hacky$ uv add --script targetedKerberoast.py impacket
 Updated `targetedKerberoast.py`
 oxdf@hacky$ head targetedKerberoast.py 
 #!/usr/bin/env python3
 # /// script
 # requires-python = ">=3.12"
 # dependencies = [
 # "impacket",
 # ]
 # ///
 # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
 # File name : targetedKerberoast.py [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jtjqx62pp3665mm9bc2gemkr)



`-r <requirements.txt file>` will add an entire file:
 oxdf@hacky$ uv add --script targetedKerberoast.py -r requirements.txt 
 Updated `targetedKerberoast.py`
 oxdf@hacky$ head targetedKerberoast.py 
 #!/usr/bin/env python3
 # /// script
 # requires-python = ">=3.12"
 # dependencies = [
 # "impacket",
 # "ldap3",
 # "pyasn1",
 # "pycryptodome",
 # "rich",
 # ] [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jtjqxg8sh5q7978sk814gy15)



Run
 Now run the script with `uv run <script>`:
 oxdf@hacky$ uv run targetedKerberoast.py 
 Installed 26 packages in 21ms
 usage: targetedKerberoast.py [-h] [-v] [-q] [-D TARGET_DOMAIN] [-U USERS_FILE] [--request-user username] [-o OUTPUT_FILE] [-f {hashcat,john}] [--use-ldaps] [--only-abuse]
 [--no-abuse] [--dc-host DC_HOST] [--dc-ip ip address] [-d DOMAIN] [-u USER] [-k] [--no-pass | -p PASSWORD | -H [LMHASH:]NTHASH | --aes-key hex key]
 targetedKerberoast.py: error: need to set credentials [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jtjqxnjkw9h4cjy8cvm0r6fh)



Shebang
 I can modify the [shebang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)) so that the script will just run with `uv run` if called directly:
 oxdf@hacky$ head targetedKerberoast.py 
 #!/usr/bin/env -S uv run --script
 # /// script
 # requires-python = ">=3.12"
 # dependencies = [
 # "impacket",
 # "ldap3",
 # "pyasn1",
 # "pycryptodome",
 # "rich",
 # ]
 Now it runs like a binary:
 oxdf@hacky$ chmod +x targetedKerberoast.py 
 oxdf@hacky$ ./targetedKerberoast.py 
 usage: targetedKerberoast.py [-h] [-v] [-q] [-D TARGET_DOMAIN] [-U USERS_FILE] [--request-user username] [-o OUTPUT_FILE] [-f {hashcat,john}] [--use-ldaps] [--only-abuse]
 [--no-abuse] [--dc-host DC_HOST] [--dc-ip ip address] [-d DOMAIN] [-u USER] [-k] [--no-pass | -p PASSWORD | -H [LMHASH:]NTHASH | --aes-key hex key]
 targetedKerberoast.py: error: need to set credentials [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jtjqyx96g3r2pq8yv7vh9wvt)
