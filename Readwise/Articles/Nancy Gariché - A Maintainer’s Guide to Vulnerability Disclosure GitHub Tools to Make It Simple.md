# A Maintainer’s Guide to Vulnerability Disclosure: GitHub Tools to Make It Simple

![rw-book-cover](https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image1.jpg)

A vulnerability report for **your** open source project. It’s your first one. [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jqdzr0z5hm25g9z63148cfj3)

## Where do you even start?

Security issues aren’t just another bug. They can be a blueprint for attackers if exposed too soon. Instead of discussing them in the open, maintainers should work with security researchers behind the scenes to fix problems before they become public. [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jqdztae6yjksta1rxg27bytp)

This approach, known as **Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD)** or **Responsible Disclosure**, keeps your users safe while giving you time to resolve the issue properly. [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jqdztkqj34bk4jpjysxeaqez)

GitHub provides tools like **Private Vulnerability Reporting (PVR)**, **draft security advisories**, and **Dependabot alerts**. These tools are free to use for open source projects, and are designed to make managing vulnerabilities straightforward and effective. [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jqdzv6gthrnd00n4wv3yvw9g)
## The vulnerability disclosure process, at a glance

Here’s a quick overview of what you should do if you receive a vulnerability report:
1. **Enable Private Vulnerability Reporting (PVR)** to handle submissions securely.
2. **Collaborate on a fix**: Use draft advisories to plan and test resolutions privately.
3. **Request a Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) identifier**: Learn how to assign a [CVE](../../Dev,%20ICT%20&%20Cybersec/High%20level/CVE%20&%20CNA.md) to your advisory for broader visibility.
4. **Publish the advisory**: Notify your community about the issue and the fix.
5. **Notify and protect users**: Utilize tools like Dependabot for automated updates. [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jqdzw1p1qbc08gn4zemcc0jm)

PVR solves the “where” and the “how” of reporting security issues. But what if you want to set clear expectations from the start? That’s where a `SECURITY.md` file comes in handy.

PVR is your front door, and `SECURITY.md` is your welcome guide telling visitors what to do when they arrive. [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jqdzxx9vr9k9j9jnfthgmxgw)

## `SECURITY.md`

A good `SECURITY.md` file includes:
- How to report vulnerabilities (ex: “Please submit reports through PVR.”)
- What information should be included in a report (e.g., steps to reproduce, affected versions, etc.) [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jqdzyg9nrhkn84thgafqmqwg)

## Draft Security Advisories

Why use draft security advisories?

- **They keep your discussion private,** so that you can work privately with your team or trusted contributors without alerting bad actors.
- **They centralize everything,** so your discussions, patches, and plans are kept in a secure workspace.
- **They’re ready for publishing when you are:** You can convert your draft advisory into a public advisory whenever you’re ready. [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jqdzzfmvkxcywwwxysxtd58z)

When a vulnerability needs broader visibility, a **Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)** identifier provides a standardized way to document and reference it. GitHub allows maintainers to request a CVE directly from their draft security advisory, making the process seamless. [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jqe00dzv6fevpcr4ffkg2wg2)

Best practices for writing an advisory[](https://github.blog/security/vulnerability-research/a-maintainers-guide-to-vulnerability-disclosure-github-tools-to-make-it-simple/#best-practices-for-writing-an-advisory)
- **Use plain language:** Write in a way that’s easy to understand for both developers and non-technical users
- **Include essential details:**
- A description of the vulnerability and its impact
- Versions affected by the issue
- Steps to update, patch, or mitigate the risk
- **Provide helpful resources:**
- Links to patched versions or updated dependencies
- Workarounds for users who can’t immediately apply the fix
- Additional documentation or best practices
