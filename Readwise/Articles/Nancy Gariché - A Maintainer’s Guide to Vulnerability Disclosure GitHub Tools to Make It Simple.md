summary: This guide helps open source maintainers manage vulnerability reports effectively using GitHub tools. It emphasizes the importance of Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD) to keep users safe while fixing issues privately. By enabling Private Vulnerability Reporting and creating clear security advisories, maintainers can improve communication and enhance project security.

# A Maintainer‚Äôs Guide to Vulnerability Disclosure: GitHub Tools to Make It Simple

![rw-book-cover](https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image1.jpg)

A vulnerability report for **your** open source project. It‚Äôs your first one. [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jqdzr0z5hm25g9z63148cfj3)

## Where do you even start?

Security issues aren‚Äôt just another bug. They can be a blueprint for attackers if exposed too soon. Instead of discussing them in the open, maintainers should work with security researchers behind the scenes to fix problems before they become public. [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jqdztae6yjksta1rxg27bytp)

This approach, known as **Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD)** or **Responsible Disclosure**, keeps your users safe while giving you time to resolve the issue properly. [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jqdztkqj34bk4jpjysxeaqez)

GitHub provides tools like **Private Vulnerability Reporting (PVR)**, **draft security advisories**, and **Dependabot alerts**. These tools are free to use for open source projects, and are designed to make managing vulnerabilities straightforward and effective. [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jqdzv6gthrnd00n4wv3yvw9g)
## The vulnerability disclosure process, at a glance

Here‚Äôs a quick overview of what you should do if you receive a vulnerability report:
1. **Enable Private Vulnerability Reporting (PVR)** to handle submissions securely.
2. **Collaborate on a fix**: Use draft advisories to plan and test resolutions privately.
3. **Request a Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) identifier**: Learn how to assign a [CVE](../../Dev,%20ICT%20&%20Cybersec/High%20level/CVE%20&%20CNA.md) to your advisory for broader visibility.
4. **Publish the advisory**: Notify your community about the issue and the fix.
5. **Notify and protect users**: Utilize tools like Dependabot for automated updates. [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jqdzw1p1qbc08gn4zemcc0jm)

PVR solves the ‚Äúwhere‚Äù and the ‚Äúhow‚Äù of reporting security issues. But what if you want to set clear expectations from the start? That‚Äôs where a `SECURITY.md` file comes in handy.

PVR is your front door, and `SECURITY.md` is your welcome guide telling visitors what to do when they arrive. [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jqdzxx9vr9k9j9jnfthgmxgw)

## `SECURITY.md`

A good `SECURITY.md` file includes:
- How to report vulnerabilities (ex: ‚ÄúPlease submit reports through PVR.‚Äù)
- What information should be included in a report (e.g., steps to reproduce, affected versions, etc.) [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jqdzyg9nrhkn84thgafqmqwg)

## Draft Security Advisories

Why use draft security advisories?

- **They keep your discussion private,** so that you can work privately with your team or trusted contributors without alerting bad actors.
- **They centralize everything,** so your discussions, patches, and plans are kept in a secure workspace.
- **They‚Äôre ready for publishing when you are:** You can convert your draft advisory into a public advisory whenever you‚Äôre ready. [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jqdzzfmvkxcywwwxysxtd58z)

When a vulnerability needs broader visibility, a **Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)** identifier provides a standardized way to document and reference it. GitHub allows maintainers to request a CVE directly from their draft security advisory, making the process seamless. [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jqe00dzv6fevpcr4ffkg2wg2)

Best practices for writing an advisory[](https://github.blog/security/vulnerability-research/a-maintainers-guide-to-vulnerability-disclosure-github-tools-to-make-it-simple/#best-practices-for-writing-an-advisory)
- **Use plain language:** Write in a way that‚Äôs easy to understand for both developers and non-technical users
- **Include essential details:**
- A description of the vulnerability and its impact
- Versions affected by the issue
- Steps to update, patch, or mitigate the risk
- **Provide helpful resources:**
- Links to patched versions or updated dependencies
- Workarounds for users who can‚Äôt immediately apply the fix
- Additional documentation or best practices
