# Watching o3 guess a photo's location is surreal, dystopian and entertaining

## Highlights


Watching OpenAI’s new o3 model guess where a photo was taken is one of those moments where decades of science fiction suddenly come to life. It’s a cross between the [Enhance Button](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnhanceButton) and [Omniscient Database](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmniscientDatabase) TV Tropes.

The process is simple. Snap a photograph of somewhere, ideally without putting any obvious landmarks in there. Feed it to ChatGPT o3 (or o4-mini) and prompt “Guess where this photo was taken”. Let it churn. [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jsxkm9pt98vg1rmnwyfr8t9g)
