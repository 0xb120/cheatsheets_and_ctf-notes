>  Put simply, an attack surface is the total number of potential entry points in the IT networks and computer systems, which malicious actors can exploit to gain unauthorized access to the system.

> Type of Assets Definition Examples Known AssetsKnown assets are the components that are properly documented, and security teams are fully aware of. Known assets include the most obvious assets, such as: ServersWorkstationsNetwork devicesApplicationsDatabases Several other IT assets Unknown AssetsThis type of IT assets are present in the IT environment, but they are not so well known and documented.Shadow IT Unauthorized devicesUnapproved applications Unacknowledged IT resourcesRogue Assets As the name implies, these are unauthorized devices or systems present in the environment without appropriate oversight. Malware Unauthorized devices Unauthorized users *Third Party Vendor Risks Third-party vendors assets are used to deliver services, such as cloud services, software solutions, or several types of outsourced IT solutions. SaaS applicationsAPIsPublicly exposed public cloud assets

> **What is Attack Surface Management?**  
>  Attack surface management (ASM) as a methodical process encompassing continuous discovery of known, unknown and third-party assets including inventory, classification, prioritization, and security monitoring of external digital assets that contain, transmit, or process sensitive data.

> ASM approach follows the same approach and methods that threat actors employ.

> **Why Attack Surface Management Matters**  
>  Maintaining visibility of Internet-facing assets is essential, as these externally exposed systems act as an initial entry point for attackers to intrude into a network.

> Here are the following key reasons for effective ASM:   
>  • **Better risk evaluation:** Attack Surface Management (ASM), when integrated with predictive risk analytics, enables better risk evaluation, contextualization, and prioritization of vulnerabilities for remedial action.
>  • **Enhances security posture:** Fortifies an organization’s overall security posture by mitigating external attack vectors effectively.
>  • **Optimizes resource allocation:** With a clear idea of attack surface, CISOs can allocate resources based on priority and risk severity.   
>  • **Minimizes operational costs:** Proactively managing the attack surface reduces the likelihood of data breaches. Thus, it minimizes the chances of financial losses associated with such incidents, downtimes.  
>  • **Improved regulatory compliance:** Proactively managing attack surface is critical to meeting regulatory compliance across many industries, such as BFSI, healthcare.

> Here are some essential capabilities of Attack Surface Management:
>  • Discover and maintain an inventory of all internet and non-internet-facing assets within an organization’s infrastructure.
>  • Map and visualize the organization’s attack surface, which allows the identification of the potential entry points, vulnerabilities, and interconnections. 
>  • Evaluate assets for known vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and other loopholes through vulnerability scanning, penetration testing, and other security testing methods.
>  • Integrate with a threat intelligence engine to stay updated on the latest threats, attack vectors, and indicators of compromise (IoCs). 
>  • Help prioritize and remediate the most critical risks, involving patching vulnerabilities, implementing access control mechanisms, and decommissioning obsolete assets.
