# Exploiting Client-Side Path Traversal to Perform Cross-Site Request Forgery - Introducing CSPT2CSRF

![rw-book-cover](https://readwise-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/static/images/article2.74d541386bbf.png)

## Highlights


The first reference we found was a [bug](https://www.facebook.com/notes/996734990846339/) reported by Philippe Harewood in the Facebook bug bounty program. Since then, we have only found a few references about Client-Side Path Traversal:
 • a [tweet](https://x.com/samwcyo/status/1437030056627523590) from Sam Curry back in 2021
 • [1-click CSRF](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/365427) in GitLab by Johan Carlsson
 • [CSS Injection](https://mr-medi.github.io/research/2022/11/04/practical-client-side-path-traversal-attacks.html) by Medi, nominated in the [Portswigger Top 10 Web hacking techniques of 2022](https://portswigger.net/research/top-10-web-hacking-techniques-of-2022)
 • a [CSRF](https://erasec.be/blog/client-side-path-manipulation/) by Antoine Roly from Erasec
 • Some other references were found about Client-Side CSRF from OWASP and in [this](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/sec21-khodayari.pdf) research paper by Soheil Khodayari and Giancarlo Pellegrino.
 Client Side Path-Traversal has been overlooked for years. While considered by many as a low-impact vulnerability, it can be actually used to force an end user to execute unwanted actions on a web application.

CSPT2CSRF with a GET Sink
 Some scenarios of exploiting CSPT with a GET sink exist:
 • Using an open redirect to leak sensitive data associated with the source
 • Using an open redirect to load malicious data in order to trigger an XSS

In fact it is often possible to chain a CSPT2CSRF having a GET sink with another state-changing CSPT2CSRF.
