# SonicBoom, From Stolen Tokens to Remote Shells - SonicWall SMA100

![rw-book-cover](https://labs.watchtowr.com/content/images/2025/05/sonicwall-sma.png)

We‚Äôre excited to share our previously private analysis of the [now exploited in-the-wild N-day vulnerabilities affecting SonicWall‚Äôs SMA100 appliance](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/sonicwall-sma100-vpn-vulnerabilities-now-exploited-in-attacks/?ref=labs.watchtowr.com). [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jtgmd05xqtcs0qv5e90prybt)

Specifically, today, we‚Äôre going to be analyzing and reproducing:
- **CVE-2024-38475** - Apache HTTP Pre-Authentication Arbitrary File Read [^1], discovered by Orange Tsai [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jtgmd5x7ej03fnnmm7e8c4a6)
- **CVE-2023-44221** - Post-Authentication Command Injection, discovered by "Wenjie Zhong (H4lo) Webin lab of DBappSecurity Co., Ltd‚Äù [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jtgmdamdctbe8dgp9e6c5170)

## DocumentRoot Confusion (Arbitrary File Read)
The first step we‚Äôre going to take is reviewing the Apache configuration file, named `httpd.conf`. This file contains the configuration settings and rewrite rules used by SonicWall: `/usr/src/EasyAccess/www/conf/httpd.conf` [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jtgme2vy2av36qny01zx4tda)

We will focus on the relevant rules to this vulnerability. [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jtgmf0r5s18s7q5qgqp1mpm0) There are many `RewriteRule` entries in the configuration.
However, we are particularly interested in the ones that don‚Äôt bind us to any specific paths ‚Äî specifically, the rules that allow access to the **root** of the filesystem.

Quickly, we can identify that such a rule does exist within this Apache `httpd.conf` config file: [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jtgmfas3bnrfedyw4wh07wq7)
```
RewriteRule ^/(.+)\\.[0-9]+\\.[0-9]+\\.[0-9]+\\.[0-9]+[A-Za-z0-9]*-[0-9]+.*\\.css$ /$1.css
```

What does a normal, valid request that satisfies this pattern look like?
Here is a valid example: https://host/static/css/85.368e547a156e93679310.css

When the above URL is accessed, the file `85.368e547a156e93679310.css` is successfully retrieved and presented to the user. [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jtgmgcp1t3v4dxzkh0g62wc2)

However, as we mentioned at the beginning of this blog, Orange Tsai discovered that if the substitution path in a `RewriteRule` statement includes a prefix pointing to the root of the filesystem, Apache will attempt to access two paths. [^2] [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jtgmjgtn005z1179x6wzy9e6)

When we access: https://host/static/css/85.368e547a156e93679310.css

Apache will try to resolve both of the following paths:  [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jtgmjyv23bvsbnfhyejmagc5)
- `/85.368e547a156e93679310.css`
- `/usr/src/EasyAccess/www/htdocs/static/css/85.368e547a156e93679310.css`

If there is a file located at `/tmp/secret.txt`, we can read it by sending the following request: https://host/tmp/secret.txt%3f.1.1.1.1a-1.css [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jtgmm9x13hvjamz20e9yhw5v)


This allows us to quickly demonstrate our ability to **read any file** readable by the user who runs the webserver process (in this case `nobody` user), by targeting a typical Apache HTTP log file.

For the purpose of this example, we‚Äôll target the file `/mnt/ram/var/log/httpd.log` by sending the following HTTP request: [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jtgmn3gmvg2dd9qkbfasapvj)
```http
GET /mnt/ram/var/log/httpd.log%3f.1.1.1.1a-1.css HTTP/1.1
Host: host 
```

The following response is returned: [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jtgmnbqxm9m2x31cgdrk5fbn)
```html

### Escalating Arbitrary File Read

We identified the file `/tmp/temp.db` - this is a SQLite database that contains a significant amount of information, but most importantly, it contains *session identifiers* for currently active sessions - jackpot. [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jtgmpgn9vsfhjkv7exf6ksx3)

Given we can read arbitrary files, surely the next step is to just exfiltrate this database as so:
`curl https://host/tmp/temp.db%3f.1.1.1.1a-1.css -o temp.db`

Happy with our progress, we loaded our newly downloaded SQLite database file into our local DB viewer and revisited the `Sessions` table. To our surprise, the `Sessions` table was empty. [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jtgmsrmh0p15k71a73w8sb1z)

Curiously, *sometimes* we would get a SQLite database with real content, and other times we wouldn‚Äôt. [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jtgmt7wg0b4nhpmwr6t61b0f)

Suddenly, we had an idea - what if, instead of downloading the entire file in a single request, we retrieved it **chunk by chunk**?

Apache, by default, supports the `Range` header ‚Äî and here‚Äôs an example of it in action, specifically requesting the byte range that we know our session ID and other important information is stored: [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jtgmv19k3234qvd553tjw3q6)
```http
GET /tmp/temp.db%3f.1.1.1.1a-1.css HTTP/1.1
Host: host
Range: bytes=7875-8000
```

This turned out to be reliable and stable. [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jtgmvbpk8h0p3y05f57ppmp4)
