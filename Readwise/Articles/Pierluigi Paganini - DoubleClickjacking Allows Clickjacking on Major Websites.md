summary: DoubleClickjacking is a new exploit that allows attackers to bypass security measures on major websites using a double-click sequence. This technique can lead to account takeovers and unauthorized changes by tricking users into clicking on malicious prompts. To counter this threat, website administrators should implement stricter controls and be aware of all clickjacking forms.

# DoubleClickjacking Allows Clickjacking on Major Websites

[DoubleClickjacking](Blog%20-%20DoubleClickjacking%20A%20New%20Era%20of%20UI%20Redressing.md) is a technique that allows attackers to bypass protections on major websites by leveraging a [double-click sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-click).

DoubleClickjacking, exploiting double-click sequences, bypasses clickjacking protections like `X-Frame-Options` and `SameSite` cookies, potentially allowing platform account takeovers. [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jgp3swyrypgq5qbgfvrkgmqq)

> “**DoubleClickjacking** is a new variation on this classic theme: instead of relying on a single click, it takes advantage of a double-click sequence. While it might sound like a small change, it opens the door to new UI manipulation attacks that bypass all known clickjacking protections, including the X-Frame-Options header or a SameSite: Lax/Strict cookie.” [Paulos Yibelo wrote](https://www.paulosyibelo.com/2024/12/doubleclickjacking-what.html). “This technique seemingly affects almost every website, leading to account takeovers on many major platforms.” [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jgp3tkc8zpr86mfbmqdy6qqm)

DoubleClickjacking exploits timing differences between mousedown and onclick events to hijack user actions. By swiftly swapping windows during a double-click, attackers redirect clicks to sensitive targets, like OAuth prompts, without relying on popunder tricks.

- An attacker starts by opening a new window through a button or automatically on a webpage.
 - Clicking the button opens a new window prompting a double-click, while the parent window is redirected to the target page (e.g., OAuth authorization).
 - The double-click closes the top window and unintentionally triggers authorization on the parent window, granting the attacker access with arbitrary scope.
