# Java Applet + Serialization in 2024! What Could Go Wrong?

## Highlights


> we needed to run the applet. A possible solution would be to run it in an old browser in a VM, but we would leave this option as a last resort. Instead, we installed a version of **OpenJDK 8** and used the **appletviewer** binary to run the applet. We preferred to use a not-very-recent version of OpenJDK to minimize compatibility issues with the old Java version probably used to compile the applet

> e created the following Java policy to **disable the security manager** in the applet (saved in file “java.policy”):
>  grant {
>  permission java.security.AllPermission;
>  };
>  Then, we **ran the applet** as follows (the URL is the URL of the page that starts the applet):
>  $ /usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk/bin/appletviewer -J-Djava.security.manager -J-Djava.security.policy=java.policy https://<TARGET>/<PAGE>.htm

> One command-line option that helped a lot is “-J-Djavax.net.debug=all”, which prints precious **debug information**:
>  $ /usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk/bin/appletviewer -J-Djava.security.manager -J-Djava.security.policy=java.policy -J-Djavax.net.debug=all https://<TARGET>/<PAGE>.htm

> We set up Burp Proxy as an **invisible proxy**, transparently redirecting the applet traffic to the HTTP port Burp Proxy was listening on.
>  To do this operation we had to first edit the */etc/hosts* file (*C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts* in Windows), adding a resolution of our target to 127.0.0.1 (assume *www.target.com* as our target):
>  127.0.0.1 www.target.com
>  Then we could setup an invisible proxy in the Proxy settings of Burp Suite as follows (you may have to run Burp Suite as root to bind on port 443):

> **Pay attention**: In the second screenshot, I used the hostname of my target instead of its IP address in the “Redirect to host” field because my target had [SNI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication) enabled. To use the hostname, however, we need to add the correct DNS resolution of the hostname inside Burp Suite. Otherwise, it will resolve again to 127.0.0.1 due to our rule in the */etc/hosts* file. If your target doesn’t have SNI enabled, you can simply put the IP address instead of the hostname in the proxy listener configuration. If your target has SNI enabled, you can add a custom DNS resolution in Burp Suite in the network settings:

>  The HTTP traffic of our applet reached Burp Proxy, but we got a certificate exception in the applet caused by the fact that Burp Suite’s certificate was self-signed and consequently not valid for the applet. To overcome this issue we simply **installed the Burp Suite CA** in the Java Keystore used for CA certificates (Burp Suite CA’s certificate can be exported from the Proxy Listener configuration tab in DER format and then can be converted to PEM format using OpenSSL):
>  $ /usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk/bin/keytool -import -alias example -keystore /usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk/jre/lib/security/cacerts -file <PATH>/certCABurp.pem
>  In order to prevent any further TLS issues we enabled all TLS protocols and ciphers in Burp Suite, including old and unsafe ones:

> **Burp Suite tip**: when you analyze an applet or more generally an application that is not a web application executed in the browser (such as a client-server application or a mobile application) remember that Burp Suite by default decompresses HTTP responses it receives from the backend to simplify the pentester’s analysis. While browsers do not complain if the content they receive from Burp Suite is not compressed, applets and other applications may break (and usually do). You can disable automatic decompression and other operations executed on HTTP requests and responses by default in the Proxy -> Miscellaneous configuration tab.
