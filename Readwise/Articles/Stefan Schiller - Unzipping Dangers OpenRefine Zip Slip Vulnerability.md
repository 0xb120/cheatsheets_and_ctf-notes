# Unzipping Dangers: OpenRefine Zip Slip Vulnerability

## Highlights


> Besides these generic techniques, there might be features of the application itself, which could be leveraged by attackers. In the case of OpenRefine, the application implements an auto-reload feature, which regularly scans the `WEB-INF` folder for changes and restarts the `WebAppContext` when a file is changed:
>  **OpenRefine/server/src/com/google/refine/Refine.java**
>  All classes within the `WEB-INF/classes` folder are reloaded during the restart of the `WebAppContext`. This means that attackers could overwrite an existing `.class` file within this folder, which triggers the reload and subsequently executes the attacker's `.class` file, resulting in the ability to execute arbitrary code.
