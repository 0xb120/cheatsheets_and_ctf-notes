# Regression Testing: The Key to Ensuring Software Quality and Reliability

Regression testing is a crucial part of software development that **ensures new code changes don't negatively affect existing functionality**. It comes into play for developers primarily after bug fixes or when adding new features.

>[!example]
>Imagine you have a beautifully working application, much like a finely tuned orchestra. Each instrument (or feature) plays its part perfectly. Now, you want to introduce a new instrument (or add a new feature). Before the next performance (or release), you need to make sure that the new instrument doesn't throw off the harmony of the orchestra. This is what regression testing doesâ€”it helps you catch any discordant notes (or bugs) that might have been introduced with the changes.

Regression testing involves re-running previously executed tests to compare the output with earlier results. It can be done manually, but it's often automated for efficiency, especially in large and complex projects.
