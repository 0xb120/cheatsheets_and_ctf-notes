# Last Week in Security (LWiS) - 2024-12-16

## Highlights


[Cleo Harmony, VLTrader, and LexiCom - RCE via Arbitrary File Write (CVE-2024-50623)](https://labs.watchtowr.com/cleo-cve-2024-50623/) - These "managed file transfer" (MFT) programs are in use by the biggest enterprises, but have shockingly little security research done against them, likely because they are hard to get your hands on (no trials, free versions, and very expensive). As this exploit is still unpatched and the details are out, if you even recognize the name Cleo you should start incident response.
