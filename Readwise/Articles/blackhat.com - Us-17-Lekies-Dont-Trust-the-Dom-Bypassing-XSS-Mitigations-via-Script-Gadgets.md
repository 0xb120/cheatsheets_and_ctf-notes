## Highlights


Script Gadget is an *existing* JS code on the page that may be used to bypass mitigations

Script Gadgets convert otherwise safe HTML tags and attributes into arbitrary JavaScript code execution.

• If a page with this gadget has an unfixed HTML injection, the attacker can inject data-text=”<script>” instead of injecting <script> • This lets the attacker bypass XSS mitigations that look for script.
 • Different gadgets bypass different mitigations

This HTML snippet: <div data-bind="value:'hello world'"></div>

These blocks create a gadget in Knockout that eval()s an attribute value. data-bind="value: foo" eval(“foo”) To XSS a Knockout-based JS application, attacker needs to inject: <div data-bind="value: alert(1)"></div>

Ajaxify gadget converts all <div>s with class=document-script into script elements. So if you have an XSS on a website that uses Ajaxify, you just have to inject: <div class="document-script">alert(1)</div>

Bootstrap has the "simplest" gadget, passing HTML attribute value into innerHTML.
 <div data-toggle=tooltip data-html=true title='<script>alert(1)</script>'> HTML sanitizers allow title attribute, because it’s usually safe.
 But they aren’t, when used together with Bootstrap and other data- attributes.

Require JS allows the user to specify the "main" module of a JavaScript file, and it is done through a custom data attribute, of which XSS filters and other mitigations aren't aware of.
 <script data-main='data:1,alert(1)' src='require.js'></script>

jQuery contains gadget that takes existing <script> tags, and reinserts them. We can inject a form and an input element to confuse the jQuery logic to reinsert our script: <form class="child"> <input name="ownerDocument"/><script>alert(1);</script></form> Strict-dynamic CSP blocks the <script>, but then jQuery reinserts it. Now it’s trusted and will execute.

• We looked for Script Gadgets in 16 popular modern JS libraries. AngularJS 1.x, Aurelia, Bootstrap, Closure, Dojo Toolkit, Emberjs, Knockout, Polymer 1.x, Ractive, React, RequireJS, Underscore / Backbone, Vue.js, jQuery, jQuery Mobile, jQuery UI • It turned out they are prevalent in the above • Only one library did not have a a useful gadget • Gadgets we found were quite effective in bypassing XSS mitigations.
