summary: Many organizations rely on the Domain Name System (DNS) to manage their internet exposure, often having thousands of DNS records that can be changed with little oversight. However, DNS is vulnerable at multiple levels, from root servers to individual records, which can lead to serious security risks if not properly managed. Automation and careful monitoring are essential to protect against potential vulnerabilities in DNS configurations.

# DNS Is the Center of the Modern Attack Surface – Are You Protecting All Levels?

It’s common to configure exposure through the [DNS - Domain Name System](../../Dev,%20ICT%20&%20Cybersec/Services/DNS%20-%20Domain%20Name%20System.md). It’s not uncommon for an organization to have over 100,000 DNS records. [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jpwear40b34v8h68bmnezpxv)

**DNS levels**
 A basic DNS lookup involves several key components that work together to complete the final query:
 1. **Root Servers:** There are 13 root servers worldwide, which serve as the authoritative source for DNS information. (Fun fact: the majority of these servers are located in NATO countries.)
 2. **Top-Level Domain (TLD):** These manage the different domain extensions, such as .com, .io, and others.
 3. **Registrars:** This is where you go to purchase your domain name.
 4. **DNS Providers:** Often associated with hosting services, content delivery networks (CDNs), or registrars, these providers facilitate DNS management.
 5. **Zones:** This refers to the configuration settings for the domain you have purchased.
 6. **Your software sends DNS queries:** This is the implementation of DNS that enables communication between machines that wish to connect with each other. [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jpweb45x6e433524epc9exbc)

 • Step 1: Check your local DNS cache/stub-resolver. If the information is present, proceed to Step 9. If not, continue to Step 2.
 • Step 2: The resolver queries the root server for information about the Top-Level Domain (TLD).
 • Step 3: Retrieve information about the TLD and then proceed to Step 4.
 • Step 4: The resolver requests information from the TLD server about the specific domain.
 • Step 5: Obtain information about the domain and move on to Step 6.
 • Step 6: The resolver queries the domain for information regarding detectify.com.
 • Step 7: Retrieve information about detectify.com and then proceed to Step 8.
 • Step 8: The DNS resolver responds with the record information related to the domain.
 • Step 9: Connect to the server that operates the application for detectify.com.
 • Step 10: Enjoy state-of-the-art security testing! [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jpwedz7ph5mpqvew5fjbshmc)
