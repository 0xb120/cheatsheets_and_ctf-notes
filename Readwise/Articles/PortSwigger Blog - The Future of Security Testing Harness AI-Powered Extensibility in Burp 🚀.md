# The Future of Security Testing: Harness AI-Powered Extensibility in Burp ðŸš€

Users of [Burpsuite](../../Dev,%20ICT%20&%20Cybersec/Tools/Burpsuite.md) Professional will initially have access to a bundle of 10,000 free AI credits, so your extension can be used immediately, without cost concerns. [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jmczny34jt7gk2737y8hs3gz)

Gareth Heyes has been experimenting with AI extensibility, and now he has enhanced his Hackvertor extension with AI-powered functionality. [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jmczp5avtc9z6j7py51gyx8b)

Gareth has enhanced Hackvertor with powerful new AI features that let you create custom tags for performing advanced transformations on a given input, all without writing a single line of code:
- Create custom tags that use AI to convert a given input based on instructions you provide as a natural language prompt.
- Use AI to automatically generate the code for a custom tag in your preferred language (JavaScript, Python, Java, Groovy) based on a given input and expected output. The AI also generates a natural language description of how the code works.
- Use AI to automatically generate pairs of tags for encoding/decoding strings based on encoded values it observes in Repeater requests. [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jmczq08t9kdvp1bcrq5f25fa)
