> The software product C-MOR is an IP video surveillance system. The manufacturer describes the product as follows: "With C-MOR video surveillance, it is possible to check your surveillance over network and the Internet. You can access the live view as well as previous recordings from any PC or mobile device. C-MOR is managed and controlled over the C-MOR web interface. IP settings, camera recording setup, user rights and so on are set over the web without the installation of any software on the client."[1] Due to insufficient input validation, the C-MOR web interface is vulnerable to OS command injection attacks.
