# Penetration Testing Reports: A Powerful Template and Guide

## Highlights


How to write impressive penetration testing reportsStart with a solid note-taking process
 Make note-taking “muscle memory” and it will serve you well. The overall reporting process will become more efficient, accurate, and less prone to errors. You’ll also be better prepared to troubleshoot issues and client concerns.

Pay attention to important elements
 Now that we have our note-taking process down, here’s a quick overview of things to pay attention to during the testing process:
 • Admin info
 • Scope
 • Targets
 • Rules of engagement (ROE)
 • Attack paths
 • Credentials found or cracked
 • Findings
 • Vulnerability scans & research
 • Service enumeration
 • Web info
 • Logs
 • Activity
 • Artifacts
 • Cleanup

**Executive Summary**
 **Objective**: Clearly explain the risks that discovered vulnerabilities present and how they’ll affect the future of the organization if exploited.
 **Length**: One or two pages. Anything more is not a summary, and will probably be overlooked. Being precise and concise is paramount.
 Any report worth reading should include an executive summary to help non-technical leaders digest and determine strategic action based on the information in your report. This section is arguably one of the most important since it will provide leadership with a bottom line up front (BLUF) summary of what was done, where defenses excelled, and what failed to stop you, the attacker.
 Keep in mind that your target audience during this part of the report are decision-makers who allocate funds to forward remediations (not technical staff who execute changes). For this reason, we want to ensure that it is easily understood and should therefore avoid using acronyms, infosec jargon, and including overly technical details.

Recommendations or remediations
 **Objective**: Provide the client with recommendations for short, medium, and long-term implementation that will improve their security posture.
 **Length**: Ideally, you want to report everything to the customers, but this could become cumbersome depending on the severity of your findings. Including the findings that are of critical, high, and maybe even medium importance is a must. If you have a large number of findings, especially in the low and informational importance, it may be best to include them all in an appendix attached to the report instead of writing a 400-page report filled with extra information

Technical Findings 
 **Objective**: Deliver technical details of how clients can remediate the security flaws that you found.
 **Length**: Length doesn't matter here, but want to be clear and concise in demonstrating the path you took and the actions required. Defenders should be able to replicate the attack based solely on your documentation of it. Screenshots are perfect for this purpose.
