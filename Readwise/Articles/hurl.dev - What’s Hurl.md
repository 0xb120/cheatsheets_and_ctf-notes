# What’s Hurl?

Hurl is a command line tool that runs **HTTP requests** defined in a simple **plain text format**. [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jq6jrh5by63x73n4fqwrmbaq)

It can chain requests, capture values and evaluate queries on headers and body response. Hurl is very versatile: it can be used for both **fetching data** and **testing HTTP** sessions. [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jq6jrrkkve4h8p5x76pwrtb0)
