summary: Hurl is a versatile command line tool for running HTTP requests in a simple text format, allowing chaining of requests, capturing values, and evaluating queries on headers and body responses. It is useful for fetching data, testing HTTP sessions, and APIs, supporting REST/JSON, and SOAP APIs, as well as performance testing HTTP endpoints. Written in Rust, Hurl uses libcurl as its HTTP engine, making it lightweight and efficient for both devops and developers. It simplifies testing by providing syntactic sugar for running and testing HTTP requests while leveraging the power of libcurl.
