# Get FortiRekt, I Am the Super_Admin Now - FortiOS Authentication Bypass CVE-2024-55591

![rw-book-cover](https://labs.watchtowr.com/content/images/2025/01/fortirekt-1.png)

>[!tldr]
>Critical zero-day vulnerability affecting FortiOS products. [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jn44xxj9khhpzsh6detgsv91)

What we could glean was that the vulnerability resided within the `jsconsole` functionality, which is a GUI feature to execute CLI commands inside FortiOS’s management interface. [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jn44ycabvssjd1dwqt2ptjfg)

Fortinet managed to publish their [advisory](https://www.fortiguard.com/psirt/FG-IR-24-535?ref=labs.watchtowr.com) for CVE-2024-55591, containing a little more information:
> An Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel vulnerability [CWE-288] affecting FortiOS and FortiProxy may allow a remote attacker to gain super-admin privileges via crafted requests to Node.js websocket module. [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jn44yvdx27xnpn6hhknejh3a)

### The file system

As you may recall from previous FortiGate adventures, a decrypted FortiGate’s `rootfs.gz` looks pretty much like this: [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jn44z4nez8c1dc8473dbsj7g)
```
bin.tar.xz
boot
data
data2
dev
etc
fortidev
init
lib
migadmin.tar.xz
node-scripts.tar.xz
proc
rootfs
sbin
sys
tmp
usr
usr.tar.xz
var
```

We used the `/sbin/xz` binary to extract a small collection of node-related files: [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jn450ay84wc1gcvbb1vc529a)
```
/ssl-vpn
/ssl-vpn/provision-user
/ssl-vpn/provision-user/qr_codes
/index.js
/f85a0baf050df19d250a479301fcbc0f.node
/logs
/report-runner
/report-runner/lang
/report-runner/sfas
/9f7fd545476a9e07af2abe8a61bcdb01.node
```

We’re quick to realize at this point that the core code for the Node.js component resides with `index.js`, which comes in at a whopping ***53,642*** lines of JavaScript code. [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jn450pyv79xrgbfxsjkapb3e)

### PoC and Conclusion

This vulnerability isn’t "just" a simple Authentication Bypass but a chain of issues combined into one critical vulnerability. To summarise this vulnerability in a digestible format, four important things are happening:
1. A *WebSocket connection* can be created from a *pre-authenticated* HTTP request. [^1]
2. A special parameter `local_access_token` can be used to *skip* session checks.
3. A [Race Condition](../../Dev,%20ICT%20&%20Cybersec/Web%20&%20Network%20Hacking/Race%20Condition.md) in the WebSocket → Telnet CLI allows us to send authentication before the server does.
4. The authentication which is raced by us contains *no unique key*, password or identifier to establish a user. We can just pick an choose our access profile (super_admin it is!). [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jn4544sm07266swjhfyejwtf)


We recently [released a detection script](https://github.com/watchtowrlabs/fortios-auth-bypass-check-CVE-2024-55591/tree/main?ref=labs.watchtowr.com) to identify vulnerable instances, as our "we promise we're nice people" gesture. [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jn454y1k0mpr16xk2z0d0q3t)
