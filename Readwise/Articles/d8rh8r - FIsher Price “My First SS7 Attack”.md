## Highlights


> **SMS Type 0**
>  Originally, it was intended for specific tasks such as debugging or updating software on a mobile device without disturbing the user. Turns out it’s pretty handy for getting location data too. Silent SMS for the win. Here’s how it works.
>  A silent SMS is delivered to the target phone. This SMS, like all others, passes through the signaling system of the mobile network. When the SMS reaches its intended recipient, the phone automatically notifies the network that it has arrived, even though it does not sound an alert or appear in the recipient’s message list. Lucky us, this is a standard message delivery feature of the GSM protocol.
>  Information about the cell tower the message was routed through is included in the network’s response to this silent SMS. This can contain information that is essential for determining the precise location of the mobile device, such as the cell ID and location area code (LAC).

> The device’s approximate location can be ascertained by examining the cell tower that was utilised to transmit the message. [OpenCellid.org](http://opencellid.org/) is great for this, as is [maprad.io](http://maprad.io/).
