summary: MCP is a framework that connects AI models to external systems, allowing real-time interactions but also exposing them to security risks. As businesses increasingly rely on MCP-enabled AI, protecting it from attacks is crucial to safeguard sensitive operations. Organizations should implement strong security monitoring and incident response plans to mitigate these threats effectively.

## Highlights


Model Context Protocol (MCP), a framework designed to bridge LLMs with external data sources and tools. [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jrw3p1dx2ra13d6w72xm56bf)



In this blog post, we’ll explore what MCP is, its architecture, the security risks it faces, and how to protect it from attacks. [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jrw3phgbbqsra9e2tcw5n0c6)



What Is MCP?
 MCP is an innovative framework that enables LLMs to connect seamlessly with external systems and leverage model-controlled tools to interact with those external systems, query data sources, perform computations, and take actions via APIs.

a user leveraging an LLM application can invoke external sources and SaaS. Tools (also known as functions) leverage this communication to perform tasks. Think of MCP as a universal translator that allows LLM applications to fetch real-time information like weather updates, cloud configurations, or user data [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jrw3steynfas8zg4pn4pe8c9)



and integrate it into their responses. [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jrw3t5yr2jgzc3cw3p78dm8g)



MCP simplifies integration by abstracting the complexities of connecting disparate systems. For end users, it means more context-aware and dynamic interactions with AI. [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jrw3vfdes3fd3kgv5pw0zayc)



While originally developed to address the inherent limitations of LLMs’ isolated knowledge bases, MCP has evolved rapidly since its initial conceptualization. The protocol now forms the backbone of modern AI agent architectures. [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jrw3w9yee0cwcps0t7qt80sd)



“Malicious Content Protocol” | Attack Vectors Against MCP Systems
 Since its introduction at the end of 2024, MCP has already been found vulnerable to several attack vectors. [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jrw43k3x61386k6zyrdkhfmw)



where attackers can compromise or leverage compromised tools to damage both cloud and desktop machines, [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jrw44b8ry1hxtxtf98bzgcqv)



Malicious Tools
 The simplest of these attack vectors is when users unknowingly adopt malicious tools while building their MCP architecture. [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jrw44rxgzk6vrp9z3zsma89a)



Below is a non-exhaustive list of examples of what’s possible across these two main types of attacks:
 **Client-Side Attack**
 • Establish persistence mechanisms,
 • Execute privilege escalation attacks, or
 • Delete critical system backups
 **Infrastructure-Side Attack**
 • Manipulate cloud resource configurations, or
 • Inject malicious code into deployment pipelines [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jrw45ke7rfqg6w1ej7pxbv55)



To add an additional level of detail to this attack, MCP servers continuously call tools available to them and respond with their names and descriptors. However, there are no measures against multiple tools sharing the same name, which means typosquatting is possible. [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jrw46q12g77szsc4bp5b7ewb)

MCP Rug Pull
 A rug pull happens when MCP tools function legitimately initially, but are designed to execute harmful operations after establishing trust. The key characteristic of rug pulls is their time-delayed malicious activity, which occurs after an update. [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jrw47z2asvz0ame1cpammhzh)



• Initial legitimate operation builds user confidence,
 • Gradual introduction of harmful behavior,
 • Exploitation of established access and permissions, leading to
 • Potential for widespread impact due to trusted status. [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jrw48735kapgqmpqewmswz33)



![](https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/MCPserver_replaces_functionality.jpg)
 MCP server replaces the functionality after the user inspects the MCP server for the first execution. Most clients do not ask for another approval and the attacker can replace its functionality with post installation steps. [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jrw489tr65drfb7kz9nt5ntt)



Tool Poisoning Attacks
 One of the challenges in detecting malicious activity in MCP tool interactions stems from the difference in what the user sees, versus what the AI model processes. Users typically only see the tool name and, often, a simplified summary of the tool’s arguments [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jrw497x2ergfrfeh8t09tnzv)



In contrast, the AI model has access to the full tool description. Attackers can exploit that gap in visibility by embedding hidden instructions – often disguised as natural language – in the tool’s comment or description sections. [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jrw49q2y0e1kfxnrwak6qqbb)



This is known as a Tool Poisoning Attack, and [was highlighted recently by Invariant Labs](https://invariantlabs.ai/blog/mcp-security-notification-tool-poisoning-attacks). [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jrw49y3ez06rd59yt0nbvzz5)



Cross-Tool Contamination
 Finally, when a single LLM agent is allowed to interact with multiple tools across different MCP servers, it introduces a new risk: One server can potentially override or interfere with another. In the case of a malicious MCP server, it can tamper with the behavior of trusted tools by injecting hidden commands without ever executing the malicious tool itself [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jrw4b26hbce89tt97srfnppa)
