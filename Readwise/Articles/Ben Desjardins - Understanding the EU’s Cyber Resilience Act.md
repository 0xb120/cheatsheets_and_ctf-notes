# Understanding the EU’s Cyber Resilience Act

## Highlights


What is the Cyber Resilience Act? 
 The Cyber Resilience Act is a new EU regulation that focuses on improving the cybersecurity of products with digital elements (PDEs) sold within the EU.

The two main categories of essential requirements outlined in the CRA are: 
 • **Product cybersecurity requirements** (Annex I, Section 1) that focus on protection against exploitable vulnerabilities and security risks in the product's design, development, and production phases (i.e., secure by design principles). 
 • **Vulnerability handling requirements** (Annex I, Section 2) that focus on identifying and documenting vulnerabilities, ensuring a rapid response to exploitable vulnerabilities, and providing users with security updates.

These categories cover both product pre-deployment and post-deployment. In the pre-deployment phase, static application security testing (SAST) and software composition analysis (SCA) both play an important role in ensuring that products are secure by design. Early and real-time [vulnerability detection and auto-fixing](https://snyk.io/blog/find-auto-fix-prioritize-intelligently-snyks-ai-powered-code/) ensure that security issues are prevented from creating more complex, bigger, and more high-stakes problems once they go into production.

Today, however, we will focus on compliance with the CRA as it relates to software supply chain security.

To meet the CRA's essential requirements — particularly around vulnerability management and timely remediation — organizations must prioritize three foundational pillars: software bill of material (SBOM) generation, vulnerability management, and rapid reporting.

The CRA requires organizations to maintain accurate and up-to-date [SBOMs](https://snyk.io/articles/software-bill-of-materials/) to promote transparency and accountability in tracking all software components. It states that SBOMs must be “in a commonly used and machine-readable format covering at the very least the top-level dependencies of the product.”

The CRA’s vulnerability handling requirements emphasize proactive identification and clear disclosure of vulnerabilities. As such, the regulation mandates regular SBOM updates to ensure that documentation reflects the current state of every component through the product lifecycle. It also instructs organizations to “address and remediate vulnerabilities without delay, including by providing security updates.”

To meet the CRA’s security monitoring and reporting requirements, organizations must maintain an accurate inventory of digital assets. Having full visibility into all PDEs, software versions, and dependencies in use allows them to pinpoint affected assets when new vulnerabilities are discovered quickly. Additionally, when an exploitable vulnerability is discovered, the CRA requires timely communication to all relevant parties (e.g., end-users, developers, manufacturers, regulators).
