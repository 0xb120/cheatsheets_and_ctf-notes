# The Best Security Is When We All Agree to Keep Everything Secret (Except the Secrets) - NAKIVO Backup & Replication

## Highlights


A quick glance shows us a Tomcat folder and a bunch of `jar` files - fantastic news.
 As always, our first aim is to understand what weâ€™re looking at, and map functionality so that we can ultimately begin to understand where we should begin prodding. As with Tomcat applications deployed via `war` files, the `web.xml` defines the routes available to the application and the corresponding servlet that supports requests to defined endpoints.
 For example, within this file:
 <servlet>
 <servlet-name>dispatcher</servlet-name>
 <servlet-class>org.springframework.web.servlet.DispatcherServlet</servlet-class>
 <load-on-startup>2</load-on-startup>
 </servlet>
 <servlet-mapping>
 <servlet-name>dispatcher</servlet-name>
 <url-pattern>/c/*</url-pattern>
 </servlet-mapping>
 In the above example, we can see that any value that follows on from the `/c/` URI is mapped to the Spring Framework class `org.springframework.web.servlet.DispatcherServlet` .
 This is typically driven by its accompanying dispatcher servlet configuration file, which contains directives on how the servlet behaves.
 For example, within this file (`dispatcher-servlet.xml`), we find the tag `<context:annotation-config/>`, which enables support for annotated controllers (`@Controller` or `@RestController`) and handler methods (`@RequestMapping`, `@GetMapping`, etc.) for jar files loaded within the classpath.
 Looking outside the Tomcat folder, we find a large `jar` file named `backup_replication.jar` which contains usage of these annotations.
 For example, we found the following annotation within `com/company/product/ui/actions/LoginController.java` , as can be seen below the `RequestMapping` maps to the URI `/login`.
 Controller
 @RequestMapping({"/login"})
 public class LoginController
 extends AbstractController
 {
 @Autowired
 @Qualifier("SettingsService")
 private SettingsService settingsService;
 @Autowired
 private RegistrationService registrationService;
 @Autowired
 private ConfigurationInfoService configurationInfoService;
 @Autowired
 private WebApplicationContext applicationContext;
 private static final Gson gson = SerializationUtils.createGsonSerializer().create();
 @RequestMapping(method = {RequestMethod.GET})
 public ModelAndView getIndex(Locale locale, HttpServletResponse response, HttpServletRequest request) {
 CanTryResponse canTryResponse;
 CanUseDefaultCredentialsResponse defaultCredentialsResponse;
 addSecurityHeaders(response::addHeader);
 By combining the prefix of the `url-pattern` in the `web.xml` with the `RequestMapping` above we arrive at a URI of `/c/login` to reach the login page.
