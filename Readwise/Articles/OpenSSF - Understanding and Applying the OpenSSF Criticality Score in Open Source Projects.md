# Understanding and Applying the OpenSSF Criticality Score in Open Source Projects

But how do we measure the significance of a project? Is it by the number of contributors? The frequency of commits? Or perhaps the organizations backing it? Enter the [OpenSSF Criticality Score](https://github.com/ossf/criticality_score), a tool that unlocks the secrets of open source projects’ criticality.

Essentially, it is a scoring system that assesses the relative importance of an open source project based on various signals and weights. These signals may include the number of contributors, commit frequency, and the number of organizations contributing to a project. Weights represent the assigned value of importance for each signal. By combining the weights with the signal values using an algorithm, the project’s score can be calculated. [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jffqdyza1dq7ckcqfftxpmct)
