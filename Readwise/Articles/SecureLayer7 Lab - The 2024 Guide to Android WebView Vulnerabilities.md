# The 2024 Guide to Android WebView Vulnerabilities

## Highlights


> **Impact of WebView Vulnerabilities**
>  One primary reason for taking WebView vulnerabilities seriously is its widespread usage. Most Android apps utilize some form of WebView functionality, making them highly vulnerable if they are adequately secured. Malicious actors can exploit these vulnerabilities to remotely execute code on devices, access private information such as login credentials or financial data, and even control the device.

> A WebView can be considered a mini-browser embedded within an app. It lets developers load and display web pages, images, and videos directly within their app without redirecting users to an external browser.

> **Security Risks and Vulnerabilities** **Associated with WebView**
>  One of the principal vulnerabilities associated with WebViews is related to cross-site scripting (XSS). XSS attacks occur when malicious code is injected into a website or app through input fields such as login forms or search bars. In Android WebView, these attacks can happen if proper security measures are not implemented during development.
>  Another common vulnerability is clickjacking or UI redressing.

> **Absence of Address Bar in WebView**
>  Many users are accustomed to having an address bar at the top of the browser window, allowing them to type in or paste a specific URL quickly. This feature is also absent in WebView. This means that users cannot directly enter a website address while using an app with WebView integration and must rely on links within the app itself.

> **Security Concerns with Limited WebView Functionalities**
>  Another important factor to consider regarding WebView’s limited functionalities is security concerns. With certain features like navigation controls and an address bar missing, malicious actors may attempt to exploit these vulnerabilities by manipulating navigation within apps or redirecting users to malicious websites without their knowledge.

> **JavaScript Execution Vulnerabilities:** Insecure configurations may allow JavaScript execution without adequate validation. It allows attackers to inject malicious code into the app’s HTML/JavaScript files, accessing cookies, session tokens, or other cached sensitive data, which can lead to session hijacking or unauthorized account access.

> **Outdated Chromium Versions:** WebView’s outdated versions present a significant risk due to known vulnerabilities. Hackers can exploit these vulnerabilities using readily available scanning tools online. Exploits range from stealing session tokens via DOM-based cross-site scripting (XSS) to executing arbitrary code with privilege escalation.

> **Identifying WebView Usage in Source Code**
>  The most common way for apps to integrate WebView functionality is using WebView classes provided by Android, such as WebSettings and WebViewClient. One should look for these class names when searching the source code. Methods such as “loadUrl()” and “evaluateJavascript()” are also indicators that an app may be using WebView.

> To check if an exported component (e.g., activity, service, broadcast receiver) indicating the use of WebView is present in our manifest file, we can use the “find” function (Ctrl+F) and search for keywords such as “WebView,” “com.android.webkit”, or “android. webkit”.
