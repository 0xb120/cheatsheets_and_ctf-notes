summary: The blog discusses vulnerabilities in open-source projects and how flaws in their disclosure process can lead to exploitation before they are patched. It highlights different stages of vulnerability exposure, such as 'Half-Day' and '0.75-Day', where attackers can identify issues through public platforms like GitHub. The research aims to improve vulnerability detection and minimize the time attackers have to exploit these flaws.

# 50 Shades of Vulnerabilities: Uncovering Flaws in Open-Source Vulnerability Disclosures

![rw-book-cover](https://blog.aquasec.com/hubfs/Threat-Alert-50-shades-of-vulnerabilities-blog-main-image.jpg#keepProtocol)

## Highlights


Aqua Nautilus researchers evaluated the vulnerability disclosure process for tens of thousands of open-source projects and found flaws in the process. These flaws allowed harvesting the vulnerabilities before they were patched and announced. [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jg49xfq2pecbyax2v8745mgy)



'0-day': A vulnerability that is unknown to the maintainer of the project. [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jg49zys2j2n7cwsqcnq2rtk2)



'1-day': A vulnerability that is known to the maintainer. Typically, the CVE/announcement is publicly published. At this stage, there is typically an available patch. However, the release of this patch can sometimes be delayed by a day or, in some cases, may not be released at all. [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jg4a0xh85bmwqaghww5zb2wh)

Another example to this process flaw it the *Text4Shell*: CVE-2022-42889, only this time it’s even worse than the one before, as the windows in this case is much bigger and illustrates a more severe scenario. 
 There were 75 days of '0.5-Day' windows, and 14 days of '0.75-Day' windows.
 The initial [pull request](https://github.com/apache/commons-text/pull/341) addressing this issue was made on July 16th, 2022. It was [merged](https://github.com/apache/commons-text/pull/341) on September 23rd, 2022, and the [official release](https://github.com/apache/commons-text/releases/tag/rel%2Fcommons-text-1.10.0) for this issue was available on September 29th, 2022, marking 75 days since the first indication of this vulnerability on GitHub. Only 14 days later, on October 13th, 2022, the CVE was [identified by NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-42889#VulnChangeHistorySection) and publicly announced.

Harvesting Methods
 How is it possible to identify such vulnerabilities on a large scale? [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jg4atq9s4b1b55e0cbjwzdrf)



On GitHub, we carried out the following steps:
 1. Compiled a list of around 15,000 popular GitHub projects along with their URLs.
 2. Utilized the GitHub REST API to analyze Open [Pull Requests](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/pulls?apiVersion=2022-11-28), [issues](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/issues?apiVersion=2022-11-28), and commit messages.
 3. Within the Pull Requests, issues, and commit messages, we searched for "trigger words" as listed below, which could indicate vulnerabilities or unwanted behavior. 
 ![](https://blog.aquasec.com/hs-fs/hubfs/4_magic_words.jpg?width=2700&height=4494&name=4_magic_words.jpg) [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jg4axdebn5z7534benkvde7p)



We reduced the data volume by checking for existing releases that were published after the Pull Request, commit, or issue was merged/closed, etc. – indicating a high likelihood of an official patch for the identified "vulnerability". We ended up with ~2,200 relevant results which were further analyzed and narrowed to ~50 (~2.3%) projects which required further in-depth analysis. [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jg4ay85xkmyxbwnvdnae2721)



Sometimes, CVEs are uploaded to the NVD before an official patch is released, happening too early in the disclosure process's lifetime [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jg4azqrrhxx4hnkar1a1vea8)



Interestingly, some have references to their GitHub commit/PR/issue while vulnerability verification is ongoing, exposing them to attackers who could potentially “harvest“ them and develop an exploit. [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jg4beee5vv0f8q7t57nh057r)



By utilizing the NVD API to fetch recently pushed CVEs and searching for GitHub references, we can then check if the commit/PR referenced by NVD has a release on GitHub that includes them. If not, this often presents a 'Half-Day' scenario, where a vulnerability is exposed without a patch at that stage. [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jg4bkdbpt50ep9ynhycph4st)



For this method, we have developed a tool that you can find on [GitHub](https://github.com/Aqua-Nautilus/CVE-Half-Day-Watcher).
 It's designed to scan the NVD for potential '0.5-Day' vulnerabilities, going back as many days as you require. [](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jg4e7a5e1jgqfx5ww0qzdr54)
> #tools 


An example of the results from November 5, 2023: Here we chose to scan a very small timeframe of two days back, and we got around 20 results of potential '0.5-Day' vulnerabilities, including some from very popular projects.

 In contrast to the previous method, which generated numerous false positives and required effort to determine if an issue triggered by a "trigger word" is indeed a security vulnerability, this method assures a high probability that the issues caught are genuine vulnerabilities.
