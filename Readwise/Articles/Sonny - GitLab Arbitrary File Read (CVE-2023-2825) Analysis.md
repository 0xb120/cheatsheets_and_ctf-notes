# GitLab Arbitrary File Read (CVE-2023-2825) Analysis

![rw-book-cover](https://labs.watchtowr.com/content/images/2023/05/56003d562eca32f3d3238e30a4c3fd59d543cd36.png)

## Highlights


> Burp Suite has an inbuilt wordlist for path traversal and a variety of encodings that have been helpful for detecting and exploiting different forms of path traversal. Typically to find this class of bug, we would use “Fuzzing - path traversal (single file)” then simply replace the `{FILE}` pattern with a file which we know is present on the target system - `/etc/passwd` is usually a good bet.
