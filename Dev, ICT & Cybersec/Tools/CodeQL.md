## Start a project using CodeQL CLI

1. Download the CodeQL binary from the [official github repo](https://github.com/github/codeql-cli-binaries/releases).
2. Build the CodeQL database starting from the actual application to test
   ```bash
   ./codeql database create /opt/codeql_db -j 4 --language=python --source-root=/opt/app --overwrite
   ```
3. Analyze the application using some basic python queries:
   ```bash
   ./codeql database analyze --download --format=CSV --output=/opt/results/codeql_results.csv /opt/codeql_db codeql/python-queries
   ```


## Custom queries

description: "One common perception is that it is easier to write rules for Semgrep than CodeQL. Having worked extensively with both of these static code analysis tools for about a year, I have some thoughts."

```bash
# Initializate a codeql pack
./codeql pack install ~/Projects/codeql-prj/queries/
```

```yml
# basic codeql pack for python
name: foo
groups: 
  - python
dependencies:
  codeql/python-all: "*"
```

```bash
# Install dependencies for the codeql pack
./codeql pack install ~/Projects/codeql-prj/queries/

# Run the custom query
./codeql query run ~/Projects/codeql-prj/queries/query2.ql -d ~/Projects/codeql-prj/db
```
