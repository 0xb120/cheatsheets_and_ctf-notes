# Tip and tricks

## Fix burpsuite browser not opening

- You need to find the chrome-sandbox binary bundled with your burpsuite : `find ~ -type f -name "chrome-sandbox"`
	- Result should be something like this: `/home/kali/.BurpSuite/burpbrowser/126.0.6478.55/chrome-sandbox`
- then: `sudo chown root:root /home/kali/.BurpSuite/burpbrowser/*/chrome-sandbox && sudo chmod 4755 /home/kali/.BurpSuite/burpbrowser/*/chrome-sandbox`

## Match and replace tricks
### Discover [SSRF](../Web%20&%20Network%20Hacking/Server%20Side%20Request%20Forgery%20(SSRF).md) easier using match and replace for any URL

Set a match & replace rule to match any URL in a request and replace it with your canary token / URL that you control!

![](attachments/SSRF-regex.png)

### Template in wordlists + match and replace

Typically to find this class of bug, we would use “Fuzzing - path traversal (single file)” then simply replace the `{FILE}` pattern with a file which we know is present on the target system - `/etc/passwd` is usually a good bet. [^match-and-replace-regex] 

```regex
Match [\{FILE\}] replace with [/etc/hosts]
```

![|500](../../zzz_res/attachments/JS-miner.png)

### *JS Link Finder

Burp Extension for a passively scanning JavaScript files for endpoint links. - Export results the text file - Exclude specific 'js' files e.g. jquery, google-analytics

### *Additional Scanner Check 🔝

This extension provides some additional passive Scanner checks:

- DOM-based XSS (regular expressions are based on those from https://code.google.com/p/domxsswiki/wiki/FindingDOMXSS)
- Missing HTTP headers:
    - Strict-Transport-Security
    - X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
    - X-XSS-Protection
- Multiple occurrences of the checked headers
- Redirection from HTTP to HTTPS

All checks can be enabled separately in an extension tab and a default config can be stored.

### *Reflected Parameters 🔝

Monitors traffic and looks for request parameter values (longer than 3 characters) that are reflected in the response. **Launch active scans against those parameters** from the apposite tab.

![|700](../../zzz_res/attachments/reflected-parameters.png)

### Paramalyzer 🔝

This extension can improve efficiency of manual parameter analysis for web penetration tests of either complex or numerous applications. This can assist in tasks such as identifying sensitive data, identifying hash algorithms, decoding parameters, and determining which parameters are reflected in the response.

This extension performs an in-depth and intelligent parameter analysis of all in-scope Burp traffic. Results are displayed in an interactive table and can be sent directly to other Burp tools such as Repeater.

See the doc: https://jgillam.github.io/burp-paramalyzer/

### *Detect Dynamic JS

This extension compares JavaScript files with each other to detect dynamically generated content and content that is only accessible when the user is authenticated. This occasionally contains not only code but also _data_ with user or session information. User/session information can then be checked for potential leakage. This extension is supposed to help hunting for exploitable situations.

To trigger the extension, simply launch a passive scan of your JavaScript files that you have requested as authenticated user. Despite being a passive scan, the extension will generate one or sometimes two request per script without cookies to get the non-authenticated version of the script.

If the same script is found to contain differing content, the extension will report an issue in the Target tab.
### *Error Message Checks 🔝

This extension passively reports detailed server error messages. You can configure arbitrary match results from the apposite tab.

![|600](../../zzz_res/attachments/java-deserializarion-scanner.png)

### *Freddy, Deserialization Bug Finder (Java and .NET)

Helps with detecting and exploiting serialization libraries/APIs **with passive and active scans**.

Freddy Features:

- **Passive Scanning** - Freddy can passively detect the use of potentially dangerous serialization libraries and APIs by watching for type specifiers or other signatures in HTTP requests and by monitoring HTTP responses for exceptions issued by the target libraries. For example the library FastJson uses a JSON field $types to specify the type of the serialized object.
- **Active Scanning** - Freddy includes active scanning functionality which attempts to both detect and, where possible, exploit affected libraries.

Active scanning attempts to detect the use of vulnerable libraries using three methods:

- **Exception Based** - In exception-based active scanning, Freddy inserts data into the HTTP request that should trigger a known target-specific exception or error message. If this error message is observed in the application's response then an issue is raised.
- **Time Based** - In some cases time-based payloads can be used for detection because operating system command execution is triggered during deserialization and this action blocks execution until the OS command has finished executing. Freddy uses payloads containing ping [-n|-c] 21 127.0.0.1 in order to induce a time delay in these cases.
- **Collaborator Based** - Collaborator-based payloads work either by issuing a nslookup command to resolve the Burp Suite Collaborator-generated domain name, or by attempting to load remote classes from the domain name into a Java application. Freddy checks for new Collaborator issues every 60 seconds and marks them in the issues list with RCE (Collaborator).

Supported target: **Java** and **.NET**

![|900](../../zzz_res/attachments/additional-cors-checks.png)

### *CSRF Scanner

Used to passively scan for [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)](../Web%20&%20Network%20Hacking/Cross-Site%20Request%20Forgery%20(CSRF).md). A dedicated tab allows to customize token's names, etc. The scanner send requests passively in background.

![|800](../../zzz_res/attachments/CSRF-scanner.png)
![|500](../../zzz_res/attachments/CSRF-scanner2.png)

### Additional CSRF Checks 🔝

This extension helps find weak CSRF-protection that can be bypassed. For example, content type based protection for API (Rest API, GraphQL API, etc) or CSRF-protection based on obscure data formats (binary format, etc) are known to be weak. Some tricks to bypass CSRF-protection were presented at [ZeroNights 2017 conference](https://2017.zeronights.org/report/tricks-bypassing-csrf-protection/).

The extension is not a scanner. This extension is a trade-off between manual and fully automatic check. The extension automatically makes changes to POST/PUT/DELETE/PATCH requests and highlights modified requests in the Proxy HTTP history.

The Settings tab provides the following options:

- Enable/disable EasyCSRF extension.
- Modify all or only in-scope requests.
- Remove HTTP headers that are used for CSRF-protection.
- Remove CSRF-token from parameters. URL-encoded, multipart, JSON parameters are supported.
- Change PUT/DELETE/PATCH method to POST.
- Convert URL-encoded body to JSON format.
- Set text/plain value for Content-Type header.
- Change POST/PUT/DELETE/PATCH request to GET request for url-encoded requests.

```

Every check script must contain a given / then statement containing one of the following:

- given response then – The check runs once for each response audited.
- given request then – The check runs once for each request audited.
- given host then – The check runs once for each host audited.
- given any insertion point then – The check runs once for each insertion point audited. Burp Scanner also uses this default option if you do not specify an insertion point type (i.e. you use given insertion point).
- given query insertion point then – The check runs once for each query audited.
- given header insertion point then – The check runs once for each header audited.
- given body insertion point then – The check runs once for each set of body content audited.
- given cookie insertion point then – The check runs once for each cookie audited.

Final rule:
```yaml
metadata:
     language: v1-beta
     name: "Possible missing Authorization header"
     description: "Tests potential API calls that don't have an Authorization header"
     author: "Dana Epp"
     tags: "CWE-864"

given response then
     if {to_lower(base.response.headers)} matches "application/json" then
          if not ("authorization:" in {to_lower(base.response.headers)}) then
               report issue:
                    severity: medium
                    confidence: firm
                    detail: `Possible API call detected without an Authorization header at {base.request.url}.`
                    remediation: "Check to see if the endpoint requires authorization or not."
          end if
     end if
```

# Bambdas

Have you heard of Bambdas? They're a unique new way to customize Burp Suite directly from the UI, using only small snippets of Java. [^intro-bambdas] 

[^intro-bambdas]: [PortSwigger Blog - Introducing Bambdas](../../Readwise/Articles/PortSwigger%20Blog%20-%20Introducing%20Bambdas.md)

*Find requests with a specific cookie value*
```java
//Find requests with a specific cookie value
if (requestResponse.request().hasParameter("foo", HttpParameterType.COOKIE)) {
	var cookieValue = requestResponse
		.request()
		.parameter("foo", HttpParameterType.COOKIE)
		.value();

	return cookieValue.contains("1337");
}

return false;
```

*Find JSON responses with wrong Content-Type*
```java
//Find JSON respones with wrong Content-Type
//The content is probably json but the content type is not application/json

var contentType = requestResponse.response().headerValue("Content-Type");

if (contentType != null && !contentType.contains("application/json")) {
 String body = requestResponse.response().bodyToString().trim();
    
 return body.startsWith( "{" ) || body.startsWith( "[" );
}

return false;
```

*Find role within JWT claims*
```java
//Find role within JWT claims
var body = requestResponse.response().bodyToString().trim();

if (requestResponse.response().hasHeader("authorization")) {
    var authValue = requestResponse.response().headerValue("authorization");
    
    if (authValue.startsWith("Bearer ey")) {
        var tokens = authValue.split("\\.");
        
        if (tokens.length == 3) {
            var decodedClaims = utilities().base64Utils().decode(tokens[1],         Base64DecodingOptions.URL).toString();
            
      return decodedClaims.toLowerCase().contains("role");
        }
    }
}

return false;
```
