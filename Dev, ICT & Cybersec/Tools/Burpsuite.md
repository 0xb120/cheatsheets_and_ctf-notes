## Traffic Auditor

### *Retire.js

Integrates Burp with the Retire.js repository to find vulnerable JavaScript libraries. It passively looks at JavaScript files loaded and identifies those which are vulnerable.

### *Software Vulnerability Scanner

Scans for vulnerabilities in detected software versions using the Vulners.com API. It adds a new page where you can analyze all the findings and add your custom regex to inspect for, and it also adds issues to the target page.

### *Software Version Reporter

Passively detects server software version numbers during scanning, spidering etc. It summarizes all the findings within a dedicated tab but it also generates issues within the Target tab.
