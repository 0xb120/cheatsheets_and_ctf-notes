```bash
$ proxychains4                                        

Usage:  proxychains4 -q -f config_file program_name [arguments]
        -q makes proxychains quiet - this overrides the config setting
        -f allows one to manually specify a configfile to use
        for example : proxychains telnet somehost.com
