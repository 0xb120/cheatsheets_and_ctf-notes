# Stripped Binary

Stripped binaries are binary **without [debugging symbols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debug_symbol)** and thus lesser in size and gives potentially better performance.

A stripped binary makes it **hard to disassemble or reverse engineer** which also in turn makes it difficult to find problems or bugs in the program.
Stripped binary can be produced with the help of the compiler itself, e.g. `gcc -s flag`, or with a dedicated tool like strip on Unix.

```bash
$ file test_stripped
test_stripped: ELF 64-bit ... dynamically linked, ... stripped
```

## Find main() in Stripped Binary

Search for `__libc_start_main()` in decompiled code or search for the entry point in gdb `info files`.
You can also set a breakpoint to `__libc_start_main`: `b __libc_start_main` or to an offset of PIE using `breakrva <offset>`

# Statically-Linked Binary

When you *statically* link a file into an executable, the contents of that file are included at link time. In other words, the contents of the file are physically inserted into the executable that you will run.

>[!warning]
>Practically, there are no references to shared libraries or external functions.

```bash
$ file test_stripped
test_stripped: ELF 64-bit ... statically linked, ... not stripped
```

## Reversing Stripped + Statically-Linked Binary

```bash
$ file test_stripped
test_stripped: ELF 64-bit ... statically linked, ... stripped
```
