# ASLR

**Address Space Layout Randomization** is security technique implemented  implemented in order to prevent an attacker from reliably jumping to, for example, a particular exploited function in memory, **ASLR randomly arranges the address space positions of key data areas of a process**, including the base of the executable and the positions of the stack, heap and libraries [^1].

**ASLR however does not affect the binary itself, it only affects libraries and environmental stuff.**

Address space randomization hinders some types of security attacks by making it more difficult for an attacker to predict target addresses.

# PIE

**Position-independent executables** (PIE) are executable binaries made entirely from position-independent code [^2].

PIE implements a random base address for the main executable binary and has been in place since 2003. It provides the same address randomness to the main executable as being used for the shared libraries.
