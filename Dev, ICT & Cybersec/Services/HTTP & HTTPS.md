## Source Code Recovery

There are various path you can try follow to retrieve an application source code:
- Get it from cloud marketplaces (AWS, Azure, GCP) and reverse it
- Get the docker image from [Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/)
- Contact sales or search for trial version
- Leak the source code using vulnerabilities ([File Inclusion (LFI & RFI)](../Web%20&%20Network%20Hacking/File%20Inclusion%20(LFI%20&%20RFI).md), [XML External Entity Injection (XXE Injection)](../Web%20&%20Network%20Hacking/XML%20External%20Entity%20Injection%20(XXE%20Injection).md), RCE, etc.)
- Reverse Engineering
	- You can use [binwalk](https://github.com/ReFirmLabs/binwalk) or even better [unblob](https://unblob.org/)[^unblob] for extracting firmwares

[^unblob]: [Frycos Security Diary - Hacking Like Hollywood With Hard-Coded Secrets](../../Readwise/Articles/Frycos%20Security%20Diary%20-%20Hacking%20Like%20Hollywood%20With%20Hard-Coded%20Secrets.md)

- [Java](../Dev,%20scripting%20&%20OS/Java.md)
- [dotNET](../Dev,%20scripting%20&%20OS/dotNET.md)

## White Box Analysis (Secure Code Review)

- If possible, always **enable database query logging** and **verbose errors**
- Use **debug print statements** in interpreted code
- Attempt to **live-debug** the target application ([dnSpy](../Tools/dnSpy.md) makes this relatively easy for .NET applications. The same can be achieved in the Eclipse IDE for Java applications although with a bit more effort)
	- For client-side languages: [67 Weird Debugging Tricks Your Browser Doesn't Want You to Know](../../Readwise/Articles/norbauer.com%20-%2067%20Weird%20Debugging%20Tricks%20Your%20Browser%20Doesn't%20Want%20You%20to%20Know.md)
- After checking **unauthenticated areas**, focus on **areas** of the application that are likely to receive less attention (i.e., authenticated portions of the application)
- **Investigate how sanitization of user input is performed**. Is it done using a trusted, opensource library, or is a custom solution in place?

### Source code analyses tools, rules and resources

>[!tip]
>Search for dangerous patterns or functions using regexes, both manually and with automated tools!

- [[semgrep]]
- [CodeQL](../Tools/CodeQL.md)
- [snyk.io](https://app.snyk.io/)
- [graudit](https://github.com/wireghoul/graudit) - grep rough audit - source code auditing tool
- [weggli](https://github.com/weggli-rs/weggli) and C/C++ ruleset from Marco Ivaldi [^ivaldi-weggli]
- [SonarSource](https://rules.sonarsource.com/) - 5000+ Static Analysis Rules across 30+ programming languages
- [cloc](https://github.com/AlDanial/cloc) - cloc counts blank lines, comment lines, and physical lines of source code in many programming languages.

For software updates and patches, focus on **diffing** [^patch][^patch-2][^patch-3] **older and newer version**:
- Read every detail contained inside the advisory in order to understand the kind of vulnerability and what/where to search inside the code
- Use the GitHub online editor or if you prefer, use [git and do patch diffing this way](../Tools/git.md#patch%20diffing)
- When analyzing and researching N-days, follows the [CVE North Stars](https://cve-north-stars.github.io/) (a method to kickstart vulnerability research by taking advantage of the CVE information freely available)

## Black Box Analysis

Black box pentesting [^black-box-pt] refers to a security test done by third party penetration testers. These external experts act like threat actors to check how safe a computer system is. 

- The tester doesn’t know anything about the system before starting.
- They only use information anyone can find online.
- They can’t see the system’s code or how it’s built inside.
- They try to find and use weak spots like a real hacker would.

[^black-box-pt]: [What is Black Box Penetration Testing?](https://blog.securelayer7.net/black-box-penetration-testing/), securelayer7.net

Focus on:
- Validation
- Sanitization
- Normalization
- [Web Services & APIs](../Web%20&%20Network%20Hacking/Web%20Services%20&%20APIs.md)
	- SOAP → WSDL (`?wsdl`)
	- REST → Swagger [^swagger-xss], OpenAPI, Postman, etc.
