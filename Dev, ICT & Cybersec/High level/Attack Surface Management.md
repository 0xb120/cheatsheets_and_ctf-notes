# Attack Surface

An attack surface refers to all the possible ways in which an attacker can gain access to and compromise a system or network. Expanding on the definition, an attack surface is essentially the sum of all the vulnerabilities and entry points that exist in a given system or network. [^attack-surface]

## Categories of attack surface

We can split attack surface categories in two main groups:

1. **Digital Attack Surface:** The digital attack surface includes all the software-based points of entry through which an attacker can attempt to gain unauthorized access to a system. This includes applications, network interfaces, operating systems, and any other digital component that can be exploited. Examples of vulnerabilities within the digital attack surface are unpatched software, weak passwords, unsecured APIs, and misconfigured security settings.
2. **Physical Attack Surface:** The physical attack surface comprises all the physical components and locations through which an attacker can gain access to a system. This includes servers, workstations, network devices, and any other hardware that can be physically tampered with. Physical attacks can involve stealing devices, tampering with hardware, or gaining unauthorized access to restricted areas.

## Attack vectors vs attack surface

Attack vectors can be defined as paths or methods used by cyber attackers to gain unauthorized access to a system or network, like:
- **Phishing**
- **Malware
- **Compromised Passwords**
- **Encryption Issues**
- **Unpatched Software**

An attack surface encompasses all potential entry points into a system that an attacker could exploit, like:
- **Web Applications**
- **User Devices**
- **Connected IoT Devices**
- **Email Servers**
- **Databases**
## Attack Surface Management

Attack surface management (ASM) as a methodical process encompassing continuous discovery of known, unknown and third-party assets including inventory, classification, prioritization, and security monitoring of external digital assets that contain, transmit, or process sensitive data.
