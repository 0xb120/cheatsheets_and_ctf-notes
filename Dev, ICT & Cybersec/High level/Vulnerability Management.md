# Vulnerability Management

Vulnerability management is a systematic process that organizations employ to identify, assess, and remediate potential security weaknesses in their IT systems.

 It's a proactive approach that aims to reduce the risk of cyberattacks and data breaches. Â  

An effective vulnerability management program typically includes the following components:
- **Asset discovery and inventory**
- **[Vulnerability Scanning](../Web%20&%20Network%20Hacking/Vulnerability%20Scanning.md)**
- **Patch and configuration management**
- **Security incident and event management (SIEM)**
- **[Penetration Testing](Penetration%20Testing.md)**
- **Threat intelligence**
- **Vulnerability remediation**
