# Application Security

Application security refers to a process of evaluating applications for identifying and fixing potential vulnerabilities and various other security weaknesses. It encompasses web, mobile, and desktop applications, as well as APIs. Its primary purpose is to take proactive steps before malicious actors can exploit these loopholes. [^securelayer7-appsec]

## Key Components of Application Security

The application security process involves a series of essential steps aimed at identifying, mitigating and preventing security vulnerabilities:
- **Risk assessment and planning**: This initial phase involves identifying potential security risks specific to the application through thorough threat modeling. It includes assessing the application's functionality, data handling processes and potential attack vectors. Based on this assessment, a security plan is developed to outline measures needed to mitigate identified risks.
- **Secure design and Secure Development**: During the design and development phase, security considerations are integrated into the application architecture and coding practices. Development teams follow secure coding guidelines and application security best practices to minimize the introduction of vulnerabilities into the codebase. This includes implementing input validation, authentication mechanisms, proper error handling and establishing secure deployment pipelines.
- **[Code Review](../Services/HTTP%20&%20HTTPS.md#White%20Box%20Analysis%20(Secure%20Code%20Review)) and testing**: Comprehensive code reviews and testing are conducted to identify and address security vulnerabilities in the application code. This involves both **static code analysis** (SAST) to identify potential flaws in the source code and **dynamic testing** (DAST) to simulate real-world attack scenarios and assess the application's resilience to exploitation.
- **Security Testing**: Security testing is performed to assess the effectiveness of implemented security controls and identify any remaining vulnerabilities. This happens primarily through **red teaming**, with capabilities like [Penetration Testing](Penetration%20Testing.md) , [Vulnerability Scanning](../Web%20&%20Network%20Hacking/Vulnerability%20Scanning.md), and security risk assessments. This testing identifies weaknesses in the application's defenses and ensures compliance with security standards and regulations.
- **Deployment and monitoring**: Once the application is ready for deployment, ongoing monitoring and maintenance are necessary to ensure continued security. This includes implementing logging and monitoring mechanisms to quickly detect and respond to security incidents. Regular security updates and patches are also applied to address newly discovered vulnerabilities and mitigate emerging threats.

Application Security usually focuses on:
- [Authentication](../Web%20&%20Network%20Hacking/Authentication.md)
- [Authorization](../Web%20&%20Network%20Hacking/Access%20control%20security%20models.md)
- Logging
- Encryption

Depending on the type of application and the corresponding platform that have to be secured, AppSec can be divided in:
- [Web Application Security](../Services/HTTP%20&%20HTTPS.md)
- [Android Application Security](../Mobile%20Hacking/Android%20Application%20Security.md)
- [Web Services & APIs Security](../Web%20&%20Network%20Hacking/Web%20Services%20&%20APIs.md)
