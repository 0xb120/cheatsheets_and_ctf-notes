# CVE

CVE stands for Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures. It is a unique ID assigned to identify each publicly known security vulnerability.
The CVE ID consists of the following format: `CVE-YYYY-NNNNN`

Where:
- CVE – Constant identifier showing this is a CVE ID
- YYYY – The year the CVE ID was assigned
- NNNNN – A unique 5-digit number to identify the specific vulnerability

# CNA

CNAs (CVE Numbering Authority) are organizations that have been authorized by the CVE Program to assign CVE identifiers to vulnerabilities affecting products within their agreed-upon scope. The CNA’s domain of authority can be specific to its own products or cover a broader range of products and vulnerabilities under its scope.

There are distinct levels in the CNA hierarchy: [^cna-rules]
1. Root
2. Top-Level Root 
3. CNA of Last Resort (CNA-LR) 
4. Sub-CNAs 

[^cna-rules]: [CVE Numbering Authority (CNA) Rules](https://www.cve.org/ResourcesSupport/AllResources/CNARules)
 
The most common and basic level of CNA is the Sub-CNA, which assigns CVE identifiers to vulnerabilities specifically within their domain of responsibility.

Currently, there are 307 CNAs (305 CNAs and 2 CNA-LRs) from 36 countries participating in the CVE Program.
