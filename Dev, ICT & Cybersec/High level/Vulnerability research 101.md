# Vulnerability research 

Vulnerability research refers to the process of gathering information to identify and analyze potential problems, whether exploitable or not, in computer systems and software. It involves using various methods and tools to examine source code or other forms of program data in order to discover vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers.

Vulnerability research can be conducted against:
- Products (eg. searching 0-days, n-days or vulns on open source projects) [^ctfstocve]
- Companies' applications and sites (eg. following some [Bug Bounty](Bug%20Bounty.md) programs)

## Find your target

Choosing a target for vulnerability research is never an easy task. Some people prefer "*going for breadth rather than depth*" and scan multiple targets searching for the *low-hanging fruit* [^cve-hinting-made-easy][^xss-wp], while others prefer going deep into topics and products that "*scare*" them or are very *significant and important* [^openssf], researching novel attack techniques [^how-james-kettle-chooses-target].

## Vulnerability DBs and numbering systems

Security vulnerabilities (**not every one!**) are classified and numbered to provide a standardized, universal way to identify and track them.

Different vulnerability classification systems and DBs exists. The most famous and used ones are:
- [CVE](CVE%20&%20CNA.md)
- CNNVD
- CNVD
- [ENISA](https://euvd.enisa.europa.eu/)

### Searching for known vulnerabilities and exploits

CVEs and tracked advisories:
- [OpenCVE](https://www.opencve.io/cve) - wrapper linking both to NIST and MITRE
- [CVEFeed](https://cvefeed.io/) - aggregate data from various sources _(such as NVD, GitHub, EPSS, CISA KEV)_ and provide a single platform that can be used to keep up to date with the latest security news.
- [NIST](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/search) (USA)
- [CVE Details](https://www.cvedetails.com/)
- [CVE (old)](https://cve.mitre.org/)
- [CVE](https://www.cve.org/)
- [VulnDB](https://vuldb.com/?search) (descriptions not quite accurate, but nice threat hunting statistics and world heat-maps)
- [Chinese NVD (CNNVD)](https://www.cnnvd.org.cn/home/childHome)
- [CNVD](https://zc.cnvd.org.cn/)

For web components, open source projects, and not tracked vulns also look at:
- [snyk](https://security.snyk.io/) - The leading database for open source vulnerabilities and cloud misconfigurations
- [OSV](https://osv.dev/list) - identify known third-party open source dependency vulnerabilities
- [GitHub Advisory DB](https://github.com/advisories) - Security vulnerability database inclusive of CVEs and GitHub originated security advisories from the world of open source software
- [!CVE](https://notcve.org/) - a common space for cybersecurity !vulnerabilities that are not acknowledged by vendors but still are serious security issues

Exploits and PoC:
- [exploit-db](https://www.exploit-db.com/) & [searchsploit](../Tools/searchsploit.md)
- [Rapid7](https://www.rapid7.com/db/) & [msfconsole](../Tools/msfconsole.md)
- [securityFocus](https://www.securityfocus.com/)
- [Packet Storm](https://packetstormsecurity.com/)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/)
- [exploitalert](https://www.exploitalert.com/)
- [Trickest CVE](https://github.com/trickest/cve) - Gather and update all available and newest CVEs with their PoC
- [Full Disclosure Mailing List](https://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/) - A public, vendor-neutral forum for detailed discussion of vulnerabilities and exploitation techniques
