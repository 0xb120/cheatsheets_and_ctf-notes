>[!question] What is Client-side template injection?
>Client-side template injection vulnerabilities arise when applications using a client-side template framework dynamically embed user input in web pages. When rendering a page, the framework scans it for template expressions and executes any that it encounters. This issue can be exploited to conduct [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](Cross-Site%20Scripting%20(XSS).md) attacks.
