It is the attack phase, where exploits are used to misuse vulnerabilities and compromise the victim machine.

## Searching for known vulnerabilities and exploits

- [Searching for known vulnerabilities and exploits](../High%20level/Vulnerability%20research%20101.md#Searching%20for%20known%20vulnerabilities%20and%20exploits)

### Fixing Public Exploits

- Cross-Compiling Exploit Code
    - **PyInstaller** ( packages Python applications into stand-alone executables for various target operating systems)
    - **mingw-64**
    
    ```bash
    kali@kali:~$ sudo apt install mingw-w64
    kali@kali:~$ i686-w64-mingw32-gcc 42341.c -o syncbreeze_exploit.exe -lws2_32
    kali@kali:~$ wine syncbreeze_exploit.exe
    ```
    
- Change Hard-coded information
    - IPs and Ports
    - Return Addresses
    - Payloads / Shellcodes
        - Fix Buffer length
        - Fix filler
        - Fix bad-chars
    - URLs and Paths
    - Credentials / Auth methods
    - Oddities such as self-signed certificates disrupt the exploit?

## Stack-Based Buffer Overflows

Three ways to detect [Stack-Based Buffer Overflow](../Reversing%20&%20Binary%20Exploitation/Stack-Based%20Buffer%20Overflow.md):

1. Source Code review
2. [Reverse Engineering of the software](../Reversing%20&%20Binary%20Exploitation/Reversing%20and%20software%20memory%20101.md)
3. [Fuzzing](../Reversing%20&%20Binary%20Exploitation/Fuzzing.md)

## Client Side Attacks

These attack vectors are particularly appealing for an attacker because they do not require direct or routable access to the victim’s machine.
