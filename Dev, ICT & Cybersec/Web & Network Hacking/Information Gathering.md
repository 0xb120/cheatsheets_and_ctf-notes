Is the phase where every possible information about the target is gather from the attacker in order to spread the attack surface

## Information gathering methods

- [Passive information gathering (OSINT)](Passive%20information%20gathering%20(OSINT).md)
- [Active information gathering](Active%20information%20gathering.md)
- [Service Enumeration](Service%20Enumeration.md)
- [Internal information gathering](Internal%20information%20gathering.md)
- [Active Directory Enumeration](Active%20Directory%20Enumeration.md)
- Physical Tracking
	- [Using SMS for Location](../../Readwise/Articles/d8rh8r%20-%20Using%20SMS%20for%20Location.md)
