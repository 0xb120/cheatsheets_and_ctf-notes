Confusion attacks are a set of vulnerabilities based on **parsing discrepancies** (aka parser differentials) between two or more elements involved, resulting in a security problem.

Confusion attacks can exist in any context, from the parsing of variables in a programming language, to the use of particular headers and browser behaviours.
