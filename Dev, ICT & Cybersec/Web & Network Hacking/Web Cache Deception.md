Web Cache Deception can be achieved [using request smuggling vulnerabilities](Exploiting%20HTTP%20Request%20Smuggling.md#Using%20request%20smuggling%20to%20perform%20web%20cache%20poisoning), but it can be obtained also through [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)](Cross-Site%20Request%20Forgery%20(CSRF).md) forcing a user into clicking a link containing an attacker known cache-buster as well as a specific extension ignored by the web-server but cached when requested.

[^deception1]: [Rachid.A - A web cache deception chained to a CSRF, the recipe](../../Readwise/Articles/Rachid.A%20-%20A%20web%20cache%20deception%20chained%20to%20a%20CSRF,%20the%20recipe.md#^972f41)

Some examples are:
```http
https://example.com/private_info.js?cachebuster=1
https://example.com/private_info/.css?cachebuster=1
https://example.com/private_info/;.png?cachebuster=1
```

Once the attack vector has been found, simply send the link containing its cache-buster to the victim. When he clicks on the link, his personal information — _the nature of which will depend on the web app_ — will be **accessible** to the attacker **via this same link**.
