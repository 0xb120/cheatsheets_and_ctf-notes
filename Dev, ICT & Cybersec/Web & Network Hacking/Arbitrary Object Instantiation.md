Arbitrary Object Instantiation vulnerabilities occur when an application instantiates objects using user-controlled data without proper validation, allowing attackers to instantiate arbitrary classes and potentially execute malicious code.

Arbitrary Object Instantiation vulnerabilities are very close to [Insecure Deserialization & Object Injection](Insecure%20Deserialization%20&%20Object%20Injection.md) vulnerabilities.
