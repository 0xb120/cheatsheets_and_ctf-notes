The **software supply chain** refers to the entire process and ecosystem involved in developing, building, and delivering software to end users. It includes all the tools, libraries, frameworks, developers, and systems used along the way.

Key components:
- **Source code** (including third-party libraries and open-source dependencies)
- **Build tools and environments**
- **Package managers**
- **Distribution platforms**
- **CI/CD pipelines** [^1]

Security in the software supply chain is critical because vulnerabilities can be introduced at any stage, especially through third-party components. 

Recent high-profile attacks (like SolarWinds or Log4Shell) have brought more attention to **software supply chain security**.
