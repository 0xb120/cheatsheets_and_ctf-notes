The analysis is done on the provided files or decompiled source code. **No app installation or execution.**

The most commonly and easily applied analysis method are conducted on the **static code**. It can be:
- **raw** (when source code provided)
- **decompiled**
- **compiled** (object)

Main tasks include:
- Reverse Engineering
- Source Code Analysis
- Security Setting Analysis
- Vulnerable or insecure code patterns searches
- Archive Analysis

# Reverse Engineering

Reversing is the process to **convert the compiled applications into human-readable source code**. Usually it is performed in order to understand the internal application functionality and search for vulnerabilities. Furthermore, reversing is a step in order to patch APK from security implementations.

General reversing steps:
1. Retrieve the APK
2. Retrieve the DEX from the APK
3. Convert the DEX to JAR
4. Decompile JAR file

Possible retrieved findings:
- **Hard-Coded Keys** or **Credentials**
- Critical **internal process** identification
- **Pinning**
- **Authentication**
- **Native Code** & **3rd Party Libraries**
    - **insecure native code** (.so)
    - **Public known vulnerabilities** in 3rd party lib

APK retrieving:
- Provided by client
- From filesystem via [adb](../Tools/adb.md) inside `/data/app` or `/data/app-private` 
	```bash
	$ adb shell pm list packages  
	$ adb shell pm path <package_name>
	$ adb pull <APK_path>
	```
- Share application feature in Android (File Manager > Apps > Select an application > Share)
- APK converters/external stores (unsafe, chose a trusted application!)

## Identify frameworks and components
Modern APK are not programmed using plain Java. They are built using **frameworks** or **modern programming languages**, and it is essential to identify them in order to better analyze the application.

### Kotlin

Application written using **Kotlin** [^kotlin] can be recognized because they contain `.kt` files inside the APK archive as well as a `kotlin` folder. It supports both R8 and ProGuard for obfuscation and code shrinking [^kotlin-obf] . 

[^kotlin]: https://kotlinlang.org/
[^kotlin-obf]: https://developer.android.com/build/shrink-code

Eventually you can also find references to annotations like `@kotlin.Metadata`, `kotlin/Metadata`, etc.


### Flutter

**Flutter** [^flutter] is an open-source UI framework for building beautiful, **natively compiled applications** for mobile, web, desktop, and embedded devices from a single codebase. The main programming language is DART. Flutter also provide a built-in obfuscation feature.

[^flutter]: https://flutter.dev/

Flutter application are usually very large in size because the Dart framework is statically linked in the application binary. We can confirm an application is built using flutter searching for `kernel_blob.bin`, `libflutter.so` and `libapp.so` inside the APK. 

We can also extract Flutter Metadata from the application using a modified version of the flutter runtime library, using [reFlutter](https://github.com/Impact-I/reFlutter)

## Manifest and source code analysis

Search for:
- Over privileged apps
- Insecure configurations
    - Exported components [^element-android-cve]
    - Insecure Android attributes (`allowBackup`, `debuggable`, `sharedUserId`)
- Dangerous permissions which can affect user privacy or charge consumption
- Usage of system-level permissions
- Dangerous code
    - SQL statements
    - Log enabled
    - Insecure protocols and deeplink
    - Weak cryptographic functions or key leaks
    - [Weak WebView configuration](Dynamic%20application%20security%20testing%20(DAST).md#WebView%20attacks%20[%20web-view-attacks])
- Check Configuration of Cryptographic Standard Algorithms
    - `Cipher`
    - `Mac`
    - `MessageDigest`
    - `Signature`
    - `AndroidKeyStore`
    - `Key`, `PrivateKey`, `PublicKey`, `SecretKeySpec`, `KeyInfo`
    - Few others in the `java.security.*` and `javax.crypto.*` packages.
    - Check Secure Random Number Generation
        - Locate uses of `java.util.Random`
    - Check way of generating and storing key material.
        - Locate uses of the cryptographic primitives in the code.
        - Some of the most frequently used classes and interfaces
