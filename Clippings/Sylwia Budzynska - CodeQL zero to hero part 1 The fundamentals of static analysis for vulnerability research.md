# CodeQL zero to hero part 1: The fundamentals of static analysis for vulnerability research

![](https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GitHub-Security-Lab.jpeg?fit=1200%2C630)

> [!summary]
> This article introduces static analysis, exemplified by GitHub's CodeQL, for vulnerability research. It details how injection vulnerabilities stem from untrusted sources flowing to dangerous sinks, and traces static analysis evolution from basic lexical matching to advanced syntactic analysis using Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) and Control Flow Graphs (CFGs). The core method, taint tracking, precisely follows user-controlled data to detect vulnerabilities, overcoming limitations of simple data flow analysis. It highlights the parser, internal representations, and analysis as key components of static analysis tools, concluding with practical challenges.

In this blog post series, we will take a closer look at static analysis concepts, present GitHub’s static analysis tool CodeQL, and teach you how to leverage static analysis for security research by writing custom CodeQL queries.

At Github, we perform static analysis in code scanning via CodeQL, our semantic analysis engine

It is possible to start using CodeQL and find vulnerabilities without digging into static analysis by using the predefined queries in the default configuration (check out our [CodeQL documentation](https://codeql.github.com/docs/)). However, learning static analysis fundamentals will enable you to define and query for specific patterns or vulnerabilities.

To facilitate learning static analysis, vulnerability research, and CodeQL, this blog contains [voluntary challenges](https://github.blog/developer-skills/github/codeql-zero-to-hero-part-1-the-fundamentals-of-static-analysis-for-vulnerability-research/?__readwiseLocation=#challenges).
