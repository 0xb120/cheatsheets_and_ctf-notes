# OAuth Non-Happy Path to ATO

> [!summary]
> The article details an OAuth non-happy path vulnerability that enables account takeover (ATO) due to implementation errors. It exploits a referer-based open redirect by forcing the target application into an unusual flow, achieved by manipulating the `response_type` parameter to cause sensitive tokens to be appended to the URL fragment. Referer research confirmed an attacker-controlled referer could be maintained across redirects using `window.open` and 3xx status codes. While Facebook and GitHub were not exploitable, Google's flow was vulnerable as it allowed `response_type=code,id_token` and `prompt=none` to bypass user interaction, ensuring the attacker's site remained the referer. This allowed the attacker to steal both `id_token` and the critical `authorization code` from the URL fragment, leading to ATO. The reported vulnerability resulted in a $3000 bounty.

**Happy Path** definition according **to** [**Wikipedia**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_path)**:**

> In the context of software or information modeling, a happy path (sometimes called happy flow) is a default scenario featuring no exceptional or error conditions. For example, the happy path for a function validating credit card numbers would be where none of the validation rules raise an error, thus letting execution continue successfully to the end, generating a positive response.

**Non-Happy Paths** definition based on Frans Rosen's write-up:

> First, let’s explain the various ways to break the OAuth-dance. When I mean break, I mean causing a difference between the OAuth-provider issuing valid codes or tokens, but the website that gets the tokens from the provider is not successfully receiving and handling the tokens. I’ll refer to this below as a “non-happy path.

green path is the happy path

red one is an non-happy path where the application continues with a different flow.

As observed, in the other flow, the web application (not the OAuth provider) redirects the user to the `referer` value without any parameter. This behavior is not a vulnerability, but it is not a common way for error handling. As a hunter, when I face these situations, I dig a little bit to discover something new.

## [Permalink](https://blog.voorivex.team/?__readwiseLocation=#heading-fragment-redirect "Permalink")Fragment Redirect

There are two common ways to redirect users: server-side and client-side. In the first method, when a user is redirected to another website, the fragment part of the URL remains unchanged, however, in a client-side redirect, the fragment part of the URL is removed with each redirect:

## [Permalink](https://blog.voorivex.team/?__readwiseLocation=#heading-response-type "Permalink")**Response Type**

To achieve the non-happy path (the red one in the diagram), I needed to force the application to derail from its normal behavior. So, I tried changing the `response_type` parameter from `code` to `id_token` (I learned the technique from [here](https://labs.detectify.com/writeups/account-hijacking-using-dirty-dancing-in-sign-in-oauth-flows/)), and I was able to enter the other flow.

## [Permalink](https://blog.voorivex.team/?__readwiseLocation=#heading-referer-research "Permalink")**Referer Research**

If I open `attacker.com` and it contains `window.open(‘google.com‘)` and it redirects me to the `x.com` by `3xx` status code, the [x.com](http://x.com/) will see the referer as `attacker.com`.

## [Permalink](https://blog.voorivex.team/?__readwiseLocation=#heading-exploitation-flow "Permalink")**Exploitation: Flow**

so the exploit flow looks like this,

1. the attacker sends a malicious link to the victim.
2. the victim opens the malicious link and an opener starts the Google OAuth flow with `response_type=id_token,code&prompt=none` as additional parameters.
3. In the opener, after the provider authorizes the victim, it sends them back to the value of the `redirect_uri` parameter, which is a target website.
4. Due to the non-happy path, the victim is redirected to the attacker's website with everything the attacker needs in the fragment section.
