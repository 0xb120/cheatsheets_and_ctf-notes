# Resecurity | Methods to Bypass OTP in Mobile Apps: Successful VAPT Scenarios

![]()

> [!summary]
> > Resecurity's VAPT engagements frequently identify API and authorization issues, especially in third-party developed mobile and SaaS apps. This white paper details common OTP bypass vulnerabilities.
>
> OTP (One-Time Password) is a form of possession-based authentication, often using TOTP tokens (hardware or software) or SMS/phone calls (though NIST advises against these for PII). OTPs are widely used in financial institutions, e-commerce, telecom, government, healthcare, email/cloud, social media, gaming, and enterprise systems.
>
> Primary causes of OTP bypass vulnerabilities include blind trust in client-side decisions, stateless or weak session tracking, and lack of response integrity checks.
>
> Two common attack vectors are:
> - **Password Reset OTP Bypass:** Attackers manipulate server responses (e.g., `success: false` to `true`) or remove the OTP parameter in the request to reset passwords without a valid OTP.
> - **Account Verification OTP Bypass:** Attackers intercept and alter server responses (e.g., `verified: false` to `true`) to bypass email/phone verification.
>
> Resecurity recommends in-depth assessments based on OWASP Web Application Security Testing (WSTG) covering information gathering, configuration, identity, authentication, authorization, session management, input validation, error handling, weak cryptography, business logic, client-side, and API testing.
>
> Resecurity offers various VAPT services and lists their team's industry certifications.

### OTP Bypass Vulnerabilities

What are the primary root causes of OTP bypass vulnerabilities?

### 1\. Blind Trust in Client-Side Decisions

Many apps treat the client (mobile device) as trustworthy. When the server sends a response like *"OTP verification failed,"* the app accepts this at face value. Attackers exploit this by intercepting and altering the response to *"OTP verified successfully"*—and the app blindly obeys, bypassing security.

### 2\. Stateless or Weak Session Tracking

Some systems don’t maintain a record of whether OTP verification was truly completed. After sending an OTP, the server forgets the context. Attackers can skip validation entirely because the server doesn’t double-check if the OTP step was legitimately finished.

### 3\. Lack of Response Integrity Checks

Responses from servers often lack digital signatures or tamper-proofing. Attackers can freely edit responses (e.g., changing *"false"* to *"true"*) because there’s no cryptographic seal to prove the data is authentic.
