This tutorial will show you how to use Puter.js to access OpenAI API capabilities for free, without needing an OpenAI API key.

Using Puter.js, you can access [GPT-5](https://developer.puter.com/encyclopedia/gpt-5), GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, GPT-4.5, o1, o3, o4, DALL-E, ... directly from your frontend code without any server-side setup.

Puter is the pioneer of the ["User Pays" model](https://docs.puter.com/user-pays-model/), which allows developers to incorporate AI capabilities into their applications while each user will cover their own usage costs. This model enables developers to offer advanced AI capabilities to users at no cost to themselves, without any API keys or server-side setup.

## Getting Started

You can use puter.js without any API keys or sign-ups. To start using Puter.js, include the following script tag in your HTML file, either in the `<head>` or `<body>` section:

`<script src="https://js.puter.com/v2/"></script> `

Nothing else is required to start using Puter.js for free access to OpenAI API models and capabilities.

## Example 1Use gpt-5-nano for text generation

`<html> <body>     <script src="https://js.puter.com/v2/"></script>     <script>         puter.ai.chat("What are the benefits of exercise?", { model: "gpt-5-nano" })             .then(response => {                 puter.print(response);             });     </script> </body> </html> `

## Example 4Use different OpenAI models

`  // Using gpt-4.1 model puter.ai.chat(     "Write a short poem about coding",     { model: "gpt-4.1" } ).then(response => {     puter.print(response); });  // Using o3-mini model puter.ai.chat(     "Write a short poem about coding",     { model: "o3-mini" } ).then(response => {     puter.print(response); });  // Using o1-mini model puter.ai.chat(     "Write a short poem about coding",     { model: "o1-mini" } ).then(response => {     puter.print(response); });  // Using 4o model puter.ai.chat(     "Write a short poem about coding",     { model: "gpt-4o" } ).then(response => {     puter.print(response); });  `

## List of supported models

`gpt-5 gpt-5-mini gpt-5-nano gpt-5-chat-latest gpt-4.1 gpt-4.1-mini gpt-4.1-nano gpt-4.5-preview gpt-4o gpt-4o-mini o1 o1-mini o1-pro o3 o3-mini o4-mini `

  
  
That's it! You now have a free alternative to the OpenAI API using Puter.js. This allows you to access GPT-4o, o4, o3-mini, o1-mini, DALL-E, ... capabilities without needing an API key or a backend. True serverless AI!
