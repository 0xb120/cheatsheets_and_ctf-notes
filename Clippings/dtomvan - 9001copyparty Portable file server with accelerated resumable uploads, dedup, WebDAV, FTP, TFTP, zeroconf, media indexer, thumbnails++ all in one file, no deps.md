> `copyparty` is a portable, all-in-one file server that requires only Python to run. It supports multiple protocols including HTTP, WebDAV, FTP, and TFTP. Key features include accelerated, resumable uploads with deduplication, a feature-rich web interface with a file manager, media player, thumbnail generation, and powerful search capabilities. It is highly configurable with per-user permissions, event hooks, and support for reverse proxies. The project aims to be a versatile, hackable, and cross-platform solution for file sharing, compatible with a wide range of operating systems and browsers.
